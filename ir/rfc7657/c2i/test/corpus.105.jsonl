Title : Differentiated Services (DiffServ) and Real-time Communication Authors : David Black Paul Jones Filename : draft-ietf-dart-dscp-rtp-00.txt Pages : 23 Date : 2014-07-31 Abstract: This document describes the interaction between Differentiated Services (DiffServ) network quality of service (QoS) functionality and real-time network communication, including communication based on the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). DiffServ is based on network nodes applying different forwarding treatments to packets whose IP headers are marked with different DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs). As a result, use of different DSCPs within a single traffic stream may cause transport protocol interactions (e.g., reordering). In addition, DSCP markings may be changed or removed between the traffic source and destination. This document covers the implications of these DiffServ aspects for real-time network communication, including RTCWEB.

Yes, something definitely needs to be done, as shaping excess traffic is not consistent with the EF service. In addition, RFC 3246 recommends against (SHOULD NOT) remarking EF traffic within a DS domain in one of the text excerpts that was in your email, so remarking should not be mentioned as a possibility. Further, RFC 3246 recommends that excess traffic SHOULD be dropped (section 3): To protect itself against denial of service attacks, the edge of a DS domain SHOULD strictly police all EF marked packets to a rate negotiated with the adjacent upstream domain. Packets in excess of the negotiated rate SHOULD be dropped.

A Proposal for the final sentence: ...exceeds that capacity must be dropped. EF compliant flows may be remarked to a different DSCP. All other new text indicated by the Diff version looks allright. Regards, Ruediger draft-dart-dscp: 3. Expedited Forwarding (EF) [RFC3246] intended for inelastic traffic. Beyond the basic EF PHB, the VOICE-ADMIT PHB [RFC5865] is an admission controlled variant of the EF PHB. Both of these PHBs are based on pre-configured limited forwarding capacity; traffic that exceeds that capacity may be shaped, remarked to a different DSCP, or dropped. RFC3246 (three excerpts): Packets belonging to a single microflow within the EF aggregate passing through a device SHOULD NOT experience re-ordering in normal operation of the device. Packets marked for EF PHB MAY be remarked at a DS domain boundary only to other codepoints that satisfy the EF PHB. Packets marked for EF PHBs SHOULD NOT be demoted or promoted to another PHB by a DS domain. If the EF PHB is implemented by a mechanism that allows unlimited preemption of other traffic (e.g., a priority queue), the implementation MUST include some means to limit the damage EF traffic could inflict on other traffic (e.g., a token bucket rate limiter). Traffic that exceeds this limit MUST be discarded. -----Ursprüngliche Nachricht----- Von: Dart [mailto:] Im Auftrag von Ben Campbell Gesendet: Samstag, 9.

The four bullet points in Section 2.1 that follow “The RTCWEB protocol suit encompasses a number of forms of multiplexing” seem to confuse RTP sessions, RTCP, and transport-layer flows. I suggest they be changed to: The RTP streams that comprise a WebRTC session can be multiplexed together in a number of ways: 1. Individual source streams are carried in one or more individual RTP streams. These RTP streams can be multiplexed onto a single transport-layer flow or sent as separate transport-layer flows. This memo only considers the case where the RTP streams are to be multiplexed onto a single transport-layer flow, forming a single RTP session; 2. The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) [RFC3550] may be multiplexed onto the same transport-layer flow as the RTP stream with which it is associated, as described in [RFC5761], or it may be sent on a separate transport-layer flow; 3. The RTP and RTCP traffic can be multiplexed with other protocols via UDP encapsulation over a common pair of UDP ports as described in [RFC5764] as updated by [I-D.petithuguenin-avtcore-rfc5764-mux-fixes]; and 4. The data may be further encapsulated via STUN [RFC5389] and TURN [RFC5766] for NAT (Network Address Translator) traversal. In the following paragraph (penultimate paragraph in Section 2.1), I suggest changing “unidirectional UDP packet flow” to “transport-layer flow” since it will not be unidirectional (since RTCP also flows in the reverse direction), and might not use UDP. In the first paragraph of section 2.2, I suggest changing “multiplexed over RTP sessions” to “multiplexed in a single RTP session” and “multiplexing of source streams in RTP sessions” to “multiplexing of source streams in a single RTP session”. In Section 6, the second bullet point refers to “an RTCP session”. There is no such thing. Rather, within a single RTP session there are RTCP packets sent that give information about the RTP streams that are being sent, and that report on the reception quality of RTP streams being received. Using a single PHB and DSCP for all RTCP packets within an RTP session might make sense, but it’s important to note that one role of RTCP is to provide an estimate of the round-trip time seen by the media, so the PHB\/DSCP will have to be chosen with care to avoid biasing that estimate too much.

{"_id":"doc-en-dart-u1FWMEiB2rf6iZRxfAY-ihiDROc","title":"","text":"(As individual) Hi, Here are some WGLC comments on draft-ietf-dart-dscp-rtp-02. Thanks! Ben. ---------------- **** Substantive: -- General: I was going to ask if we can be more precise on what sort of layering (and muxing?) we expect to really happen on top of DTLS, especially for WebRTC use cases. But I think Colin's comments are on the right track, so I will comment in that thread. -- Abstract (and intro) It's probably worth mentioning that, other than mixing RTP\/RTCP, RTP multiplexing is a relatively new thing. It's needed by new work such as WebRTC and clue, and it is enabled by bundle. The point being, this wasn't something we really needed to worry about until now. -- Section 2.1, list item 3: \"An RTP session could be multiplexed with other protocols ... \" What is likely to really happen here? I don't think we will see an arbitrary mixing of other protocols in the immediate future. What are the realistic constraints, and likely layerings? For example, with WebRTC, we are likely to see some number of RTP\/RTCP streams, stun, turn, and dtls, with dtls carrying one or more SCTP associations (i.e. data channels) right? Do we have ways to signal more than that in sdp-bundle? OTOH, I guess one could argue that people might try to mix in more things in the future. -- 2.1, 2nd to last paragraph, last sentence (starting with \"In contrast...\" Is this specific to SCTP associations carried over DTLS packets a la RFC5764, or are we talking about SCTP\/UDP in general? -- 2.2, third paragraph: Are we talking about TCP as the outer transport protocol, and muxing things on the TCP 5-tuple? Or are we considering TCP as something that might get multiplexed on the UDP 5-tuple? Where do Jonathan Lennox's comments about potentially falling back to an ICE TCP candidate fit? -- section 3, paragraph 5: Does the term \"network node\" include application endpoints that might do initial DiffServ marking? -- section 3, paragraph 12: \"... observable forwarding behavior (e.g., loss, delay, jitter) will often depend only on the relative loading of the link\" Relative to what? Other links? Relative load to the capacity of the link? -- section 4: It might be nice to have a more WebRTC-ish example. For example an audio stream, video stream, and a data channel carrying something like a shared white board or game. -- section 6, last bullet: Is there a such thing as \"less than best effort traffic\" where \"best effort\" treatments would be unacceptable? Actually, it's not clear to me from this paragraph if CS1 is ever appropriate, at least from the application endpoint perspective, as it seem to give completely unpredictable results. -- Normative References: Are these first two references both \"normative\" enough to block on them? **** Editorial: -- section 1, paragraph 1: \"As a result use of different DSCPs...\" Missing comma after \"result\". -- 3.2, paragraph 1: \"... and such nodes remark traffic ...\" May remark? Always remark? -- 3.2, paragraph 3, last sentence: Is this sentence redundant to the previous paragraph? -- 4, paragraph 1: 2nd and 3rd sentence These sentences seem to contradict. The first says that receiving audio early is not useful, but the second says it may be useful. -- 4, 2nd paragraph: \"... e.g., are in an AF class ...\" in the _same_ AF class? -- 5.1, 7th paragraph Is this paragraph redundant with previous discussions of AF classes? -- 5.2, third paragraph: Can you elaborate on what it means to be \"contained in a buffer\"? -- 5.2, around paragraph 5: There are words about why non-interactive media is likely to have larger jitter buffers, but the fact that interactive media may have smaller buffers us left to implication. -- 5.3, 1st and 2nd sentence: These seem redundant to previous discussions about AF classes. -- 5.3, 2nd paragraph: It's not clear to me what this paragraph means. Is drop likelihood the likelihood that anything is dropped in a session, or the chance of any given packet being dropped? I assume drop likelihood is relative to that of other sessions crossing the same path? And that under non congested conditions none of this will matter? -- 6, 1st paragraph: \" ... the following requirements ...\" Are these requirements per se, or guidelines? -- 6, bullet list Each bullet starts with a verb, but ommits the subject. E.g., in the first bullet, what is the actor that should not use different DSCPs within a different stream? -- 6, 1st bullet: The double negation is confusing (\"should not use\", \"If this is not done...\"). Also, 2nd bullet: Is \"use a single PHB and DSCP\" different than just saying \"use a single DSCP\"? 3rd bullet: Am I correct in assuming SCTP multihoming is not an issue here? Should we mention that explicitly?"}

{"_id":"doc-en-dart-AWXDhymTUkr7phy_RiQqx1o2BG8","title":"","text":"Last Call review - drat-ietf-dart-dscp-rtp-02 Summary: This document is not ready for IETF Last Call, but close. The recommendations are reasonable and reasonably argued, but the precision and specificity of the language needs to be tightened up before publication. The below addresses some specific concerns. Section 2 nit: “communication in real-time” -“communication in real time” nit: The complex example needs to mention that there may be non-media streams; suggest “there may be multiple media and non-media streams”. 2.1 Reference to SSRC for reference clock is wrong - “an RTP stream may contain multiple source streams that use the same reference clock (SSRC)” - this should be “clock, identified by the same CNAME”. The SSRC has to be different for each RTP stream in an RTP session. (The naming choice here is confusing….) The section needs to mention that RTP can be carried over a non-datagram protocol such as TCP, but that this document does not say more about this - just to show that its omission is deliberate, not accidental. (In fact 5.3 discusses TCP-encapsulated RTP. So it’s appropriate to mention it here.) STUN is not an encapsulation protocol, so should be omitted from the “encapsulated via STUN” sentence. TURN is. STUN packets are, however, multiplexed with the RTP packets. Agree that the UDP stream is not unidirectional. 2.2 STUN\/TURN paragraph sits oddly here. It seems to belong outside the “reasons for multiplexing” flow. Perhaps move it to the beginning of the section? Again, STUN description needs tuning; STUN is used also for enabling communication without a relay server, by exchanging publicly-visible IP addresses and ports. 4. “receiving the audio packets ahead of the video is not useful” -“is not very useful” - the next sentence gives a reason why it is somewhat useful. 5.1 Diffserv, Reordering and Transport Protocols The paragraph “Reordering also affects other forms of congestion control” is wrong. The content is OK, but the intro is not - it is the differential treatment (including drop probability) that creates problems for RMCAT, not (just) the reordering. DCCP is sensitive to differential treatment, since it does congestion control, so description of it as “problem free” is wrong. I think there are considerations coming from reordering (which affect protocols with immediate feedback, such as ACK-based protocols), and there are consdierations from diferential treatment (guessing wrong about what’s affected by a queue). The former applies to TCP; the latter applies to TCP, SCTP, DCCP, and (probably) whatever RMCAT comes to. These two should be separated. 5.2 DiffServ, reordering and real time communication The last paragraph of the section is somewhat misleading - network packet reordering done for *whatever* reason has no upper bound. If the authors think that packet reordering is more likely to be problematic with different DSCPs than with the same DSCP, that’s what they should say. The reference to RTCP multi-stream optimization seems completely wrong. The grouping into RTCP reporting groups is about receiver SSRCs that see the same set of packets, not about grouping reports about different SSRC together. (unless I’ve misunderstood something). When not using multi-stream optimization, these SSRCs send duplicate reports. 6. Guidelines The word “requirements” seems at odds with the headline “guidelines”. The word “session” is used several times without explanation - “RTCP session”, “reliable transport protoocol session”. From context, I guess “flow” or “connection” would be more appropriate. I wonder if the first requirement can be phrased in the positive? For instance: Within a single RTP stream, should use a single PHB and DSCP, or a set of PHBs and DSCPs that do not allow reordering, for instance a single AF class. All in all, the document*'s recommendations are clear and reasonable, but the document can be improved. -- Surveillance is pervasive. Go Dark."}

However, SCTP performs congestion control and retransmission across the entire association, and not on a per-stream basis. Although there may be advantages to using multiple drop precedence across SCTP streams or within an SCTP stream that does not use reliable ordered delivery, there is no practical operational experience in doing so (e.g., the SCTP sockets API [RFC6458] does not support use of more than one DSCP for an SCTP association). As a consequence, the impacts on SCTP protocol and implementation behavior are unknown and difficult to predict. Hence a single PHB and DSCP should be used for all packets in an SCTP association, independent of the number or nature of streams in that association.

Gorry Hi Gorry, the following text will likely appear in the next version of my diffserv-intercon draft. The more DSCPs appear in a flow which aren't deployed end-to-end for the corresponding PHB, the more often one of the scenarios will be encountered. The following scenarios start from a domain sending IP traffic using a PHB and a corresponding DSCP to an interconnected domain. The receiving domain may Support the PHB and offer the same corresponding DSCP Not support the PHB and use the DSCP for a different PHB Not support the PHB and not use the DSCP Support the PHB with a differing DSCP, and the DSCP of the sending domain is not used for another PHB Support the PHB with a differing DSCP, and the DSCP of the sending domain is used for another PHB Another question to be answered then is how a network provider will treat unrecognized or unexpected DSCPs received at network boundaries.

{"_id":"doc-en-dart-Xr_GN7Rs2THIkW5RP7bzlSLtJlQ","title":"","text":"Hi Colin, I've picked up your changes (including RTCWEB -WebRTC globally) in my working draft, with two exceptions: (1) Items 3 and 4 in the list of what can be multiplexed. I don't think you suggested any changes to these two items, but they need significant attention for other reasons: Ben's comment that item 3 ought to focus on the WebRTC data channel STUN doesn't encapsulate WebRTC traffic (TURN does). I plan to merge these items 3 and 4 as part of revising them, and intend to move the topic of TURN encapsulation out to be discussed elsewhere, as it's independent of multiplexing. I'll propose specific text in a separate message. (2) PHBs and DSCPs for RTCP. I'm not sure what to say about this, as it looks like I need to set off a discussion (debate?) between you and my co-author, Paul Jones. Colin (from WGLC comments): Rather, within a single RTP session there are RTCP packets sent that give information about the RTP streams that are being sent, and that report on the reception quality of RTP streams being received. Using a single PHB and DSCP for all RTCP packets within an RTP session might make sense, but it's important to note that one role of RTCP is to provide an estimate of the round-trip time seen by the media, so the PHB\/DSCP will have to be chosen with care to avoid biasing that estimate too much. Paul (from shortly after the Toronto meeting: During the meeting, there was discussion of marking RTCP packets. Some notes I received on this topic suggested that it was proposed that RTCP should be marked the same as for RTP. The argument was that this is used for RTT calculations. If that is what was said, I'd like to state my disagreement. :-) The forward and reverse paths are not necessarily the same and there is nothing one should assume about the reverse path to provide guidance about the forward path (or vice versa). As perhaps a gross example, I have the ability to download far faster on my home Internet connection than I can upload. Other important traffic characteristics differ in each direction. Further, an RTCP packet might provide information related to several different RTP packets. I certainly would not want to see one RTCP packet per RTP packet. I'll watch where that discussion goes before proposing text.

The four bullet points in Section 2.1 that follow \"The RTCWEB protocol suit encompasses a number of forms of multiplexing\" seem to confuse RTP sessions, RTCP, and transport-layer flows. I suggest they be changed to: The RTP streams that comprise a WebRTC session can be multiplexed together in a number of ways: 1. Individual source streams are carried in one or more individual RTP streams. These RTP streams can be multiplexed onto a single transport-layer flow or sent as separate transport-layer flows. This memo only considers the case where the RTP streams are to be multiplexed onto a single transport-layer flow, forming a single RTP session; 2. The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) [RFC3550] may be multiplexed onto the same transport-layer flow as the RTP stream with which it is associated, as described in [RFC5761], or it may be sent on a separate transport-layer flow; 3. The RTP and RTCP traffic can be multiplexed with other protocols via UDP encapsulation over a common pair of UDP ports as described in [RFC5764] as updated by [I-D.petithuguenin-avtcore-rfc5764-mux-fixes]; and 4. The data may be further encapsulated via STUN [RFC5389] and TURN [RFC5766] for NAT (Network Address Translator) traversal. In the following paragraph (penultimate paragraph in Section 2.1), I suggest changing \"unidirectional UDP packet flow\" to \"transport-layer flow\" since it will not be unidirectional (since RTCP also flows in the reverse direction), and might not use UDP. In the first paragraph of section 2.2, I suggest changing \"multiplexed over RTP sessions\" to \"multiplexed in a single RTP session\" and \"multiplexing of source streams in RTP sessions\" to \"multiplexing of source streams in a single RTP session\". In Section 6, the second bullet point refers to \"an RTCP session\". There is no such thing. Rather, within a single RTP session there are RTCP packets sent that give information about the RTP streams that are being sent, and that report on the reception quality of RTP streams being received. Using a single PHB and DSCP for all RTCP packets within an RTP session might make sense, but it's important to note that one role of RTCP is to provide an estimate of the round-trip time seen by the media, so the PHB\/DSCP will have to be chosen with care to avoid biasing that estimate too much.

The four bullet points in Section 2.1 that follow \"The RTCWEB protocol suit encompasses a number of forms of multiplexing\" seem to confuse RTP sessions, RTCP, and transport-layer flows. I suggest they be changed to: The RTP streams that comprise a WebRTC session can be multiplexed together in a number of ways: 1. Individual source streams are carried in one or more individual RTP streams. These RTP streams can be multiplexed onto a single transport-layer flow or sent as separate transport-layer flows. This memo only considers the case where the RTP streams are to be multiplexed onto a single transport-layer flow, forming a single RTP session; 2. The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) [RFC3550] may be multiplexed onto the same transport-layer flow as the RTP stream with which it is associated, as described in [RFC5761], or it may be sent on a separate transport-layer flow; 3. The RTP and RTCP traffic can be multiplexed with other protocols via UDP encapsulation over a common pair of UDP ports as described in [RFC5764] as updated by [I-D.petithuguenin-avtcore-rfc5764-mux-fixes]; and Can we clarify what \"other protocols\" are expected? Are we just talking about WebRTC data-channels over SCTP\/DTLS, or other things? If the latter, are we talking things we expect to do today, or in immediate futures, or extensions that might happen someday? 4. The data may be further encapsulated via STUN [RFC5389] and TURN [RFC5766] for NAT (Network Address Translator) traversal. In the following paragraph (penultimate paragraph in Section 2.1), I suggest changing \"unidirectional UDP packet flow\" to \"transport-layer flow\" since it will not be unidirectional (since RTCP also flows in the reverse direction), and might not use UDP. In the first paragraph of section 2.2, I suggest changing \"multiplexed over RTP sessions\" to \"multiplexed in a single RTP session\" and \"multiplexing of source streams in RTP sessions\" to \"multiplexing of source streams in a single RTP session\". In Section 6, the second bullet point refers to \"an RTCP session\". There is no such thing. Rather, within a single RTP session there are RTCP packets sent that give information about the RTP streams that are being sent, and that report on the reception quality of RTP streams being received. Using a single PHB and DSCP for all RTCP packets within an RTP session might make sense, but it's important to note that one role of RTCP is to provide an estimate of the round-trip time seen by the media, so the PHB\/DSCP will have to be chosen with care to avoid biasing that estimate too much. Editorial: the protocol is called WebRTC, but the working group is RTCWEB. Accordingly, I think all instances of \"RTCWEB\" in this draft need to change to \"WebRTC\".

{"_id":"doc-en-dart-1JNyM6ctimkEBhpN-kbSeABORD8","title":"","text":"In addition to his helpful comments to the list, Colin Perkins sent me a private suggestion to double check the DART dscp-rtp draft text against this requirement in Section 2 of draft-ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements-05.txt on Congestion Control Requirements For RMCAT: 9. Flows managed by this algorithm and flows competing against at a bottleneck may have different DSCP[RFC5865] markings depending on the type of traffic, or may be subject to flow-based QoS. A particular bottleneck or section of the network path may or may not honor DSCP markings. The algorithm should attempt to leverage DSCP markings when they're available. I think the DART dscp-rtp draft text is ok wrt that RMCAT draft text, as the RMCAT draft uses the unmodified word \"flow\" and hence is silent on presence, absence, and\/or scope of multiplexing. It's also the case that the DART draft is supposed to document the present state of things, whereas this RMCAT requirements draft concerns future congestion control mechanisms. OTOH, the text in the DART draft on coupled congestion controllers appears to be somewhat off, as the guideline on avoidance of reordering within the scope of a common (coupled) congestion controller only applies when all bottlenecks are assumed to be shared, as opposed to when measurements are used to detect them. That makes the second half of the first guideline bullet in Section 6 too broad, and may suggest some additional edits to the text on shared bottleneck detection in Section 5.1. Here are the text changes that should correct this situation: -- Section 5.1 OLD Shared bottlenecks can be detected via correlations of measured metrics such as one-way delay. An alternative approach assumes that the set of packets on a single 5-tuple marked with DSCPs that do not allow reordering will utilize a common network path and common forwarding resources at each network node. NEW Shared bottlenecks can be detected via techniques such as correlation of one-way delay measurements across RTP streams. An alternate approach is to assume that the set of packets on a single 5-tuple marked with DSCPs that do not allow reordering will utilize a common network path and common forwarding resources at each network node. -- Section 6 After: o Should not use different PHBs and DSCPs that allow reordering within a single RTP stream. If this is not done, significant network reordering may overwhelm implementation assumptions about reordering limits, e.g., jitter buffer size, causing poor user experiences, see Section 5.2 above. OLD When a common (coupled) congestion controller is used across multiple RTP streams, this recommendation against use of PHBs and DSCPs that allow reordering applies across all of the RTP streams that are within the scope of a single common (coupled) congestion controller. NEW This guideline applies to all of the RTP streams that are within the scope of a common (coupled) congestion controller that does not use per-RTP-stream measurements for bottleneck detection.

Thanks! Ben. ---------------- **** Substantive: -- General: I was going to ask if we can be more precise on what sort of layering (and muxing?) we expect to really happen on top of DTLS, especially for WebRTC use cases. But I think Colin's comments are on the right track, so I will comment in that thread. Dealt with in other thread, on mux items 3 and 4 in Section 2.1. -- Abstract (and intro) It's probably worth mentioning that, other than mixing RTP\/RTCP, RTP multiplexing is a relatively new thing. It's needed by new work such as WebRTC and clue, and it is enabled by bundle. The point being, this wasn't something we really needed to worry about until now. Could you suggest text for the Introduction section, along with any additional references? -- Section 2.1, list item 3: \"An RTP session could be multiplexed with other protocols ... \" What is likely to really happen here? I don't think we will see an arbitrary mixing of other protocols in the immediate future. What are the realistic constraints, and likely layerings? For example, with WebRTC, we are likely to see some number of RTP\/RTCP streams, stun, turn, and dtls, with dtls carrying one or more SCTP associations (i.e. data channels) right? Do we have ways to signal more than that in sdp-bundle? OTOH, I guess one could argue that people might try to mix in more things in the future. Dealt with in other thread. -- 2.1, 2nd to last paragraph, last sentence (starting with \"In contrast...\" Is this specific to SCTP associations carried over DTLS packets a la RFC5764, or are we talking about SCTP\/UDP in general? It's SCTP\/UDP in general, clarified. -- 2.2, third paragraph: Are we talking about TCP as the outer transport protocol, and muxing things on the TCP 5-tuple? Or are we considering TCP as something that might get multiplexed on the UDP 5-tuple? Where do Jonathan Lennox's comments about potentially falling back to an ICE TCP candidate fit? It's TCP as the outer transport protocol, and this is part of the text that responds to Jonathan Lennox's comments (the rest of it is hidden in 5.3, and needs some more prominence, as it's missing from the guidelines). I added: When TURN selects use of TCP, the entire real-time communications session is carried over a single TCP 5-tuple. And added mention of this scenario (TURN selects TCP) to the guideline on TCP. -- section 3, paragraph 5: Does the term \"network node\" include application endpoints that might do initial DiffServ marking? No, changed to \"node in the network\". -- section 3, paragraph 12: \"... observable forwarding behavior (e.g., loss, delay, jitter) will often depend only on the relative loading of the link\" Relative to what? Other links? Relative load to the capacity of the link? Removed \"relative\" ;-). -- section 4: It might be nice to have a more WebRTC-ish example. For example an audio stream, video stream, and a data channel carrying something like a shared white board or game. Sure, please send text. -- section 6, last bullet: Is there a such thing as \"less than best effort traffic\" where \"best effort\" treatments would be unacceptable? I can come up with possible examples - background bulk transfer of something large that should not interfere with foreground WebRTC data that is being carried as best-effort. Actually, it's not clear to me from this paragraph if CS1 is ever appropriate, at least from the application endpoint perspective, as it seem to give completely unpredictable results. That was intended - would you like to see stronger language? -- Normative References: Are these first two references both \"normative\" enough to block on them? Well, the first one certainly is - if the relevant terminology in the rtp-grouping-taxonomy draft changes, this DART draft will change also, as has already been demonstrated. OTOH, I'll move both RFC 5764 and the rfc5764-mux-fixes draft to informative. **** Editorial: -- section 1, paragraph 1: \"As a result use of different DSCPs...\" Missing comma after \"result\". Fixed. -- 3.2, paragraph 1: \"... and such nodes remark traffic ...\" May remark? Always remark? It's \"may remark,\" but I rephrased for clarity - the sentence now reads: When DiffServ is used, the edge or boundary nodes of a network are responsible for ensuring that all traffic entering that network conforms to that network's policies for DSCP and PHB usage, and such nodes may change DSCP markings on traffic to achieve that result. -- 3.2, paragraph 3, last sentence: Is this sentence redundant to the previous paragraph? Not completely, but I moved the point about ignoring embedded headers into the previous paragraph and removed this sentence. -- 4, paragraph 1: 2nd and 3rd sentence These sentences seem to contradict. The first says that receiving audio early is not useful, but the second says it may be useful. Changed second sentence to talk about increased reliability of receiving audio ... because more reliable arrival of audio helps assure smooth audio rendering ... -- 4, 2nd paragraph: \"... e.g., are in an AF class ...\" in the _same_ AF class? Yes, changed to \"a single AF class\". -- 5.1, 7th paragraph Is this paragraph redundant with previous discussions of AF classes? I don't think the paragraph is redundant, but I removed \"as the three PHBs in an AF class differ solely in drop precedence.\" as that is redundant with 3.1. -- 5.2, third paragraph: Can you elaborate on what it means to be \"contained in a buffer\"? Added: \"because packets that arrive out of order are retrieved in order from the jitter buffer for rendering.\" -- 5.2, around paragraph 5: There are words about why non-interactive media is likely to have larger jitter buffers, but the fact that interactive media may have smaller buffers us left to implication. Elaborated first sentence in previous bullet - it now ends with \"such as interactive conversations for which small jitter buffers are necessary to preserve human perceptions of real-time interaction.\" -- 5.3, 1st and 2nd sentence: These seem redundant to previous discussions about AF classes. Tightened up - the point about same forwarding resources implying no latency variation needs to be made here. New text: Packets on the same 5-tuple that use PHBs within a single AF class can be expected to draw upon the same forwarding resources on network nodes (e.g., use the same router queue) and hence use of multiple drop precedences within an AF class is not expected to cause latency variation. -- 5.3, 2nd paragraph: It's not clear to me what this paragraph means. Is drop likelihood the likelihood that anything is dropped in a session, or the chance of any given packet being dropped? I assume drop likelihood is relative to that of other sessions crossing the same path? And that under non congested conditions none of this will matter? Deleted second sentence, and rephrased first to: When PHBs within a single AF class are mixed within a flow, the resulting overall likelihood that packets will be dropped from that flow is a mix of the drop likelihoods of the PHBs involved. I also joined it up w\/the previous paragraph. -- 6, 1st paragraph: \" ... the following requirements ...\" Are these requirements per se, or guidelines? Guidelines. -- 6, bullet list Each bullet starts with a verb, but ommits the subject. E.g., in the first bullet, what is the actor that should not use different DSCPs within a different stream? The subject was factored out - \"applications and other traffic sources\". I moved it to start a new paragraph. -- 6, 1st bullet: The double negation is confusing (\"should not use\", \"If this is not done...\"). Also, Now reads: \" Should limit use of DSCPs within a single RTP stream to those whose PHBs do not allow packet reordering.\" 2nd bullet: Is \"use a single PHB and DSCP\" different than just saying \"use a single DSCP\"? The latter is better for \"applications and other traffic sources\" Extensive editing resulted,. 3rd bullet: Am I correct in assuming SCTP multihoming is not an issue here? Should we mention that explicitly? It's not an issue, and does not really need to be mentioned here. Switching among addresses involved in SCTP multihoming is a transient affect akin to (and possibly caused by) routing changes, and that's already mentioned in Section 5.1."}

I’m about to post a -03 version which is not completely done. Thanks, --David From: Dart [mailto:] On Behalf Of Harald Alvestrand Sent: Friday, August 22, 2014 9:47 AM To: Subject: [Dart] HTA's Last Call review - drart-dscp-rtp-02 Last Call review - drat-ietf-dart-dscp-rtp-02 This document is not ready for IETF Last Call, but close. The recommendations are reasonable and reasonably argued, but the precision and specificity of the language needs to be tightened up before publication. The below addresses some specific concerns. Section 2 nit: “communication in real-time” -“communication in real time” nit: The complex example needs to mention that there may be non-media streams; suggest “there may be multiple media and non-media streams”. DLBFixed both. 2.1 Reference to SSRC for reference clock is wrong - “an RTP stream may contain multiple source streams that use the same reference clock (SSRC)” - this should be “clock, identified by the same CNAME”. The SSRC has to be different for each RTP stream in an RTP session. (The naming choice here is confusing….) DLBThe text refers to a single RTP stream that contains multiple source streams, but only one SSRC. DLBAre you sure that this needs to change to CNAME from SSRC? I’d prefer not to introduce the CNAME DLBconcept if it’s not necessary. The section needs to mention that RTP can be carried over a non-datagram protocol such as TCP, but that this document does not say more about this - just to show that its omission is deliberate, not accidental. (In fact 5.3 discusses TCP-encapsulated RTP. So it’s appropriate to mention it here.) DLBDone. STUN is not an encapsulation protocol, so should be omitted from the “encapsulated via STUN” sentence. TURN is. STUN packets are, however, multiplexed with the RTP packets. DLBAgree, see text in separate message. Agree that the UDP stream is not unidirectional. DLBAgree, and picked up Colin’s suggested change here. 2.2 STUN\/TURN paragraph sits oddly here. It seems to belong outside the “reasons for multiplexing” flow. Perhaps move it to the beginning of the section? Again, STUN description needs tuning; STUN is used also for enabling communication without a relay server, by exchanging publicly-visible IP addresses and ports. DLBOk, I see “sits oddly”. I’ve moved this text into Section 2.1 and adjusted it - see the -03 draft when it’s posted. 4. “receiving the audio packets ahead of the video is not useful” -“is not very useful” - the next sentence gives a reason why it is somewhat useful. DLBChanged to “significantly ahead” and changed next sentence to be about reliability instead of timing (early). 5.1 Diffserv, Reordering and Transport Protocols The paragraph “Reordering also affects other forms of congestion control” is wrong. The content is OK, but the intro is not - it is the differential treatment (including drop probability) that creates problems for RMCAT, not (just) the reordering. DLBI don’t think so. If RMCAT can’t cope with a video stream that uses multiple PHBs from an AF class, something is wrong. DLBI’ll tag this as an open issue in the draft - could you start a separate thread that includes the RMCAT WG to sort this DLBout? DCCP is sensitive to differential treatment, since it does congestion control, so description of it as “problem free” is wrong. DLBYup, serious thinko by yours truly, see other message on that specific topic for new text. I think there are considerations coming from reordering (which affect protocols with immediate feedback, such as ACK-based protocols), and there are consdierations from diferential treatment (guessing wrong about what’s affected by a queue). The former applies to TCP; the latter applies to TCP, SCTP, DCCP, and (probably) whatever RMCAT comes to. These two should be separated. DLBI’m not sure that I understand what you’re asking for, and I’m not sure whether I agree. I believe that SCTP is DLBTCP-like in being ACK-based, DCCP is covered by text in the other message on that topic, and “whatever RMCAT comes to” DLBis speculative (although the draft does have text on Michael Welzl’s concern about coupled congestion controllers that DLBdon’t use measurements to detect bottlenecks). DLBIs there specific text on this topic that can be identified as wrong or misleading and proposed alternative text? 5.2 DiffServ, reordering and real time communication The last paragraph of the section is somewhat misleading - network packet reordering done for *whatever* reason has no upper bound. If the authors think that packet reordering is more likely to be problematic with different DSCPs than with the same DSCP, that’s what they should say. DLBOk, paragraph now reads: Network packet reordering has no effective upper bound, and can exceed the size of any reasonable jitter buffer. In practice, the size of jitter buffers for replay is limited by external factors such as the amount of time that a human is willing to wait for replay to start. Use of different DSCPs that allow reordering is more likely to cause reordering problems than use of a single DSCP or set of DSCPs that does not allow reordering. The reference to RTCP multi-stream optimization seems completely wrong. The grouping into RTCP reporting groups is about receiver SSRCs that see the same set of packets, not about grouping reports about different SSRC together. (unless I’ve misunderstood something). When not using multi-stream optimization, these SSRCs send duplicate reports. DLBThe DART draft text does not mention SSRCs, and appears to be consistent with Section 3 and the first paragraph DLBof Section 3.1 of draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-multi-stream-optimisation-03. The point is that any use of different DSCPs DLBfor different RTP streams breaks the (twice-stated) requirement in that AVTCORE draft for an identical view of the DLBnetwork conditions” across the RTP streams involved, each of which has its own SSRC. DLBI don’t think the current DART draft text is actually wrong, but I’d welcome editing suggestions that improve clarity. 6. Guidelines The word “requirements” seems at odds with the headline “guidelines”. DLBFixed. The word “session” is used several times without explanation - “RTCP session”, “reliable transport protoocol session”. From context, I guess “flow” or “connection” would be more appropriate. DLBRTCP text will be fixed when open issue is resolved on list. I wonder if the first requirement can be phrased in the positive? For instance: Within a single RTP stream, should use a single PHB and DSCP, or a set of PHBs and DSCPs that do not allow reordering, for instance a single AF class. DLBDone, Ben also noticed this. All in all, the document's recommendations are clear and reasonable, but the document can be improved. DLBThank you. -- Surveillance is pervasive. Go Dark."}

This is the core of open issue [B] and resolving it is likely to resolve much of open issue [F]. I think we're just scratching at a deeper issue here: What is the role of the RTT estimate, and is RTT what we're looking for? In ack-based congestion control, RTT estimates are used to determine when we should say \"we have not seen the ACK we expected\" - which indicates either packet loss or increased congestion, either on the forward or the reverse path - the algorithm does not care which. The signal is only useful for end-of-packet-train packet loss (because otherwise there will be later packets leading to SACK indications of lost packets before the RTT timer runs out), so the exact value doesn't really matter - only that the false positive rate isn't too high. In delay-based, sender-side-only congestion control, however, RTT has to be used as a stand-in for the sender-receiver transit time (because we have nothing else). So any variation in return-path RTT is going to be interpreted as congestion change on the forward path - which means wrong decisions. My conclusions are two: If delay-based senders-side-only is used, what matters is that the feedback signal gets there with as little delay variation as possible. The highest precedence available should be used. Delay-based schemes need to have the timing done at receiver. RTT is just too sensitive to errors. The last argument belongs in RMCAT, not here. I'll leave the first argument for your consideration.

As this work relates to RMCAT, determining one-way delay or changes thereto will likely prove important. In general, I would expect perceived quality to be important and conveying quality metrics and\/or providing feedback to the sender so that perceived quality improves (in whatever form) will be important. I'm suspicious of use of any RTT calculation for any mechanism that might be used to improve QoE. Getting feedback to the sender is important, though. In an ideal world, I would argue that RTCP packets should be marked with whatever DSCP value will deliver RTCP packets in the most expedient way. Since we don't have an ideal world, I don't know which DSCP value that would be. There are several options we could consider: Mark all RTCP packets as CS0 Mark RTCP packets using a locally-defined \"highest priority\" marking Mark RTCP packets the same as media flow for the first (active) SDP line (thus, if audio is the first m= line in SDP and that flow is active, all RTCP packets will be marked the same as audio) Specify a value for all RTCP packets irrespective of any value used in RTP flows I think the right folks on the thread and on the list are present to help make that choice.

Jones ()\" <; \"\" <: 8\/25\/2014 2:12:01 PM Subject: Re: [Dart] Colin Perkins comments - WGLC: draft-ietf-dart-dscp-rtp-02 On Aug 25, 2014, at 6:19 AM, Colin Perkins <: (2) PHBs and DSCPs for RTCP. I'm not sure what to say about this, as it looks like I need to set off a discussion (debate?) between you and my co-author, Paul Jones. Colin (from WGLC comments): Rather, within a single RTP session there are RTCP packets sent that give information about the RTP streams that are being sent, and that report on the reception quality of RTP streams being received. Using a single PHB and DSCP for all RTCP packets within an RTP session might make sense, but it's important to note that one role of RTCP is to provide an estimate of the round-trip time seen by the media, so the PHB\/DSCP will have to be chosen with care to avoid biasing that estimate too much. Paul (from shortly after the Toronto meeting: During the meeting, there was discussion of marking RTCP packets. Some notes I received on this topic suggested that it was proposed that RTCP should be marked the same as for RTP. The argument was that this is used for RTT calculations. If that is what was said, I'd like to state my disagreement. :-) The forward and reverse paths are not necessarily the same and there is nothing one should assume about the reverse path to provide guidance about the forward path (or vice versa). As perhaps a gross example, I have the ability to download far faster on my home Internet connection than I can upload. Other important traffic characteristics differ in each direction. Further, an RTCP packet might provide information related to several different RTP packets. I certainly would not want to see one RTCP packet per RTP packet. I'll watch where that discussion goes before proposing text. One of the uses of RTCP is certainly to estimate the round-trip time, as described in Section 6.4.1 (page 41) of RFC 3550. The DSCP marking used for RTCP does need to take this use into account. Ideally, this would mean RTCP packets were marked the same as the corresponding RTP packets, as I suggested in the meeting. However, Paul is correct that this only works when all RTP packets have the same marking. Accordingly, I’m not sure what the right marking is for RTCP. One approach might be to say that an SSRC that sends RTP packets with different marking should use marking with the highest(lowest?) precedence of those is uses for RTCP, so the RTT estimate calculated from RTCP is representative of some RTP packets.

Looking closer, that discussion in the current DART draft currently says: RTCP multi-stream reporting optimizations for an RTP session [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-multi-stream-optimisation] assume that the RTP streams involved experience the same packet loss behavior. This mechanism is highly inappropriate when the RTP streams involved use different PHBs, even if those PHBs differ solely in drop precedence. That's based on this text from the last paragraph of Section 1 (Introduction) of the multi-stream optimization draft: This memo defines such an RTCP extension, RTCP Reporting Groups. This extension is used to indicate the SSRCs that originate from the same endpoint, and therefore have identical reception quality, hence allowing the endpoints to suppress unnecessary RTCP reception quality reports. When different DSCPs are used for SSRCs (RTP streams) that originate from the same source, the statement that they \"therefore have identical reception quality\" is clearly incorrect, so it looks like the current DART draft text is correct, IMHO.

There won't always be one (e.g., is CS2 higher priority than AF2x? That depends ...). OTOH, we don't need to say much here, e.g., the class selector codepoints (CSx) are ordered, and adding a pointer to draft-ietf-tsvwg-rtcweb-qos will be helpful. <\/editor hat offTurning to the other RTCP issue, [F] on multi-stream optimization, I wonder whether we inadvertently framed that issue backwards. Given the above, a single RTCP report on multiple RTP streams that use rather different DSCPs may not result in representative RTT values for all of the streams, because the report has to be sent with one DSCP. If that outcome is a problem, one should send separate RTCP reports (duh!). Each reporting SSRC sends a separate RTCP report block for each SSRC it receives, so this is not a problem. The question is what marking an SSRC uses for the RTCP packets it sends, given that it uses several different markings for the RTP media packets it sends. That statement seems valuable to make and can be made with a citation of RFC 3530, as opposed to the multi-stream optimization draft. Harald and Colin - what do you think? The discussion of the multi-stream-optimisation draft is a separate issue, and is correct as it is. -- Colin Perkins"}

Colin Since DSCP values cannot be assumed to any particular PHB behavior in the network, that makes answering that question challenging. My personal preference in a voice\/video conference would be to use the same marking as is used for those flows -- and I would use the same value for both voice and video. However, if the app sharing video is considered more important by some applications, perhaps that's the value that should be used in those applications.

(It's been a while...) The more difficult case is when an SSRC is sending video using different markings for RTP packets carrying the I- and P-frames. Should that SSRC then mark its RTCP packets like the RTP packets carrying I-frames, like the RTP packets carrying P-frames, or what? For this, I would argue it should be whatever DSCP that has the lower drop precedence (in the case of assured forwarding). Otherwise, it should be the same as the media, I'd think. You mean the RTCP for each SSRC should use the DSCP with the lowest drop preference of those used for the media sent by that SSRC? That's what I'm suggesting. So, a video flow using AF4x would use AF41 for RTCP. I suggest that, since I assume we don't want to lose feedback information if we can avoid it. Paul"}

Looking closer, that discussion in the current DART draft currently says: RTCP multi-stream reporting optimizations for an RTP session [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-multi-stream-optimisation] assume that the RTP streams involved experience the same packet loss behavior. This mechanism is highly inappropriate when the RTP streams involved use different PHBs, even if those PHBs differ solely in drop precedence. A quick follow-up to ensure this is clear: the multi-stream-optimisation cannot be used when reporting on received RTP streams where the different streams have different markings, since those streams are treated differently in the network. The marking I use for the RTP streams I send (and hence the marking I use for my RTCP packets) doesn’t influence whether I can use the multi-stream-optimisation, however. Colin That's based on this text from the last paragraph of Section 1 (Introduction) of the multi-stream optimization draft: This memo defines such an RTCP extension, RTCP Reporting Groups. This extension is used to indicate the SSRCs that originate from the same endpoint, and therefore have identical reception quality, hence allowing the endpoints to suppress unnecessary RTCP reception quality reports. When different DSCPs are used for SSRCs (RTP streams) that originate from the same source, the statement that they \"therefore have identical reception quality\" is clearly incorrect, so it looks like the current DART draft text is correct, IMHO.

OTOH, we don't need to say much here, e.g., the class selector codepoints (CSx) are ordered, and adding a pointer to draft-ietf-tsvwg-rtcweb-qos will be helpful. <\/editor hat offTurning to the other RTCP issue, [F] on multi-stream optimization, I wonder whether we inadvertently framed that issue backwards. Given the above, a single RTCP report on multiple RTP streams that use rather different DSCPs may not result in representative RTT values for all of the streams, because the report has to be sent with one DSCP. If that outcome is a problem, one should send separate RTCP reports (duh!). Each reporting SSRC sends a separate RTCP report block for each SSRC it receives, so this is not a problem. The question is what marking an SSRC uses for the RTCP packets it sends, given that it uses several different markings for the RTP media packets it sends. That statement seems valuable to make and can be made with a citation of RFC 3530, as opposed to the multi-stream optimization draft. Harald and Colin - what do you think? The discussion of the multi-stream-optimisation draft is a separate issue, and is correct as it is. -- Colin Perkins -- Colin Perkins"}

Jones <: I agree that the value should be one of the values used for media, but the challenge is specifying which DSCP value to use. If audio is sent using EF, video as AF41, app sharing video as AF31, etc., which of these does the endpoint choose to use for RTCP? Such an endpoint will have three SSRC values, and will mark the RTCP packets sent by each SSRC in the same way as the media packets sent by that SSRC. That is, the RTCP relating to the audio will be marked EF, the RTCP relating to the video will be marked AF41, and the RTCP relating to the application sharing video will be marked AF31. The RTCP packets for each stream are sent separately, so this case seems straight-forward. I'm a little confused here. These are separate SSRCs, but all part of a single RTP session. So, wouldn’t the three SSRCs be reported in different report blocks in the sender report? Each of the SSRCs will report on all the others, unless the rtp-multi-stream-optimisation draft is used, but so what? Oh, I think I understand what you are saying. You're saying that each media flow (SSRC) would be responsible for sending its own RTCP packets and those packets would be marked in the same way as that media flow. In that case, I agree with you. Yes. That said, would we really require the sending SSRC to include any data for the other SSRCs if they're each sending RTCP packets separately? That seems redundant. Does RFC 3550 require that? (It’s been a while...) RFC 3550 does require that, and it is redundant (except that it indicates that the SSRCs are co-located); draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-multi-stream-optimisation-04 offers an extension to avoid it in some cases. The more difficult case is when an SSRC is sending video using different markings for RTP packets carrying the I- and P-frames. Should that SSRC then mark its RTCP packets like the RTP packets carrying I-frames, like the RTP packets carrying P-frames, or what? For this, I would argue it should be whatever DSCP that has the lower drop precedence (in the case of assured forwarding). Otherwise, it should be the same as the media, I'd think. You mean the RTCP for each SSRC should use the DSCP with the lowest drop preference of those used for the media sent by that SSRC? That's what I'm suggesting. So, a video flow using AF4x would use AF41 for RTCP. I suggest that, since I assume we don't want to lose feedback information if we can avoid it. Makes sense. -- Colin Perkins"}

This looks okay (the correction in your next message is good also). You might also add something along the lines of “If the SDP bundle extension [cite] is used to negotiate sending multiple types of media in a single RTP session, then the receivers will send separate RTCP reports for each type of media, using a separate SSRC for each media type; those RTCP reports need to be marked with the DSCP corresponding to the type of media handled by the reporting SSRC.” This guidance may result in different DSCP markings for RTP streams and RTCP receiver reports about those RTP streams. The resulting variation in network QoS treatment by traffic direction could result in unrepresentative round trip time (RTT) estimates that don't correspond to consistent network QoS treatment in both directions. I don’t think this is a problem. The media doesn’t get consistent network QoS treatment in both directions, and the RTCP is trying to sample the RTT seen by the media, so this is fine.

I would like to do two things: The justification for \"single DSCP\" in SCTP and DCCP is \"we don't know what will happen\".

DavidI’ll swap the order of sections 7 and 8, then delete this parenthetical remark now ;-). Section 5.1: \"\"\" In general, marking packets with different DSCPs results in different PHBs being applied at nodes in the network, making reordering possible due to use of different pools of forwarding resources for each PHB. \"\"\" This seems like a pretty import, so I would state it more strongly. It doesn't just make reordering possible, it makes it much more likely. (This is the flip side of the Section 6 comment above.) David“possible” -“very likely”"}

{"_id":"doc-en-dart-AAa7c_zM0aNrsC5xo3EQy1a1CkY","title":"","text":"Hi Ruediger, Sorry for being late with my review. No apology necessary - you have the honor of submitting the first IETF Last Call comments on this draft. There's one change I'd like to suggest: Section 3.1, list number 2. briefly explains AF. The section doesn't explicitly mention that traffic carried by one of the three PHBs of an AF class are not reordered. This feature, avoiding reordering packets belonging to different PHBs of an AF class, is however a kind of punch line whenever AF is referred to in later sections. So I'd welcome mentioning it in section 3.1, list point 2. Sure, that's a good suggestion - I'll do that. That absence of reordering concept is covered elsewhere in the draft, but it first shows up in Section 5.1, so mentioning it earlier in Section 3.1 will help. On the minor comments, I'd just as soon not tinker with the example text in Section 4, our AD suggested emphasizing that point in Section 5.1 (but if other reviewers dislike \"very\", that word can be bit-bucketed), and the ECMP implementation described in your comments is one that cannot claim to support AF, as it does not meet the requirements of RFC 2597. It's a network operator responsibility to not run AF across such an implementation; I think that sort of DiffServ operational concern is best covered elsewhere. My current inclination is not to make any changes for these minor comments. And one editorial comment: Section 3., last bullet point and following section: the bullet point is focused on Lower Effort PHB marked by CS 1 and the following section continues by discussing CS 1 issues more general. This discussion may be added to the bullet point (to me the discussion doesn't seem to be related to the first bullet point). That's a good catch - the paragraph after that CS1 bullet point mixes two concepts that ought to be teased apart and merged into the two foregoing bullets to improve clarity: Expanding on the non-requirements for different class selector code points to provide service differentiation. This text should be merged into the first bullet. Expanding on the problems with assuming that CS1 selects a Lower Effort service. This text should be merged into the second (CS1) bullet.
