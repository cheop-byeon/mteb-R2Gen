If audio is sent using EF, video as AF41, app sharing video as AF31, etc., which of these does the endpoint choose to use for RTCP? Such an endpoint will have three SSRC values, and will mark the RTCP packets sent by each SSRC in the same way as the media packets sent by that SSRC. That is, the RTCP relating to the audio will be marked EF, the RTCP relating to the video will be marked AF41, and the RTCP relating to the application sharing video will be marked AF31. The RTCP packets for each stream are sent separately, so this case seems straight-forward. I'm a little confused here. These are separate SSRCs, but all part of a single RTP session. So, wouldn’t the three SSRCs be reported in different report blocks in the sender report? Each of the SSRCs will report on all the others, unless the rtp-multi-stream-optimisation draft is used, but so what? Oh, I think I understand what you are saying. You're saying that each media flow (SSRC) would be responsible for sending its own RTCP packets and those packets would be marked in the same way as that media flow. In that case, I agree with you. Yes. That said, would we really require the sending SSRC to include any data for the other SSRCs if they're each sending RTCP packets separately? That seems redundant. Does RFC 3550 require that? (It’s been a while...) RFC 3550 does require that, and it is redundant (except that it indicates that the SSRCs are co-located); draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-multi-stream-optimisation-04 offers an extension to avoid it in some cases. The more difficult case is when an SSRC is sending video using different markings for RTP packets carrying the I- and P-frames. Should that SSRC then mark its RTCP packets like the RTP packets carrying I-frames, like the RTP packets carrying P-frames, or what? For this, I would argue it should be whatever DSCP that has the lower drop precedence (in the case of assured forwarding). Otherwise, it should be the same as the media, I'd think. You mean the RTCP for each SSRC should use the DSCP with the lowest drop preference of those used for the media sent by that SSRC? That's what I'm suggesting. So, a video flow using AF4x would use AF41 for RTCP. I suggest that, since I assume we don't want to lose feedback information if we can avoid it.

There is another little point though. We've been discussing port numbers as though they are transport-independent. Actually, a classifier needs to look at the protocol number (TCP, UDP, SCTP, DCCP etc) before it knows for sure where the port numbers are. So debating this point before draft-ietf-rtcweb-transports-05 is rock solid may be a little academic. I don't think generic classifiers are set up for \"SCTP over DTLS over ICE\" for example. As far as anything at all in RTCWEB is rock solid, the decision to use UDP is rock solid. So we can take that as a given for RTCWEB. (apart from the case where one uses TCP because the firewalls don't allow UDP...) Generic classifiers will detect the traffic as UDP, and may be able to tell RTP from DTLS-encapsulated data in the same way as the DTLS\/RTP demultiplexing does it. -- Surveillance is pervasive.

DiffServ is based on network nodes applying different forwarding treatments to packets whose IP headers are marked with different DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs). WebRTC applications, as well as some conferencing applications, have begun using the Session Description Protocol (SDP) bundle negotiation mechanism to send multiple traffic streams with different QoS requirments using the same network 5-tuple. Use of different DSCPs to obtain different QoS treatments within a single network 5-tuple, the results (e.g., reordering) may cause transport protocol interactions, particularly with congestion control functionality. In addition, DSCP markings may be changed or removed between the traffic source and destination. This document covers the implications of these DiffServ aspects for real-time network communication, including WebRTC.

I don't think you suggested any changes to these two items, but they need significant attention for other reasons: - Ben's comment that item 3 ought to focus on the WebRTC data channel - STUN doesn't encapsulate WebRTC traffic (TURN does). I plan to merge these items 3 and 4 as part of revising them, and intend to move the topic of TURN encapsulation out to be discussed elsewhere, as it's independent of multiplexing. I'll propose specific text in a separate message. That’s fine. (2) PHBs and DSCPs for RTCP. I'm not sure what to say about this, as it looks like I need to set off a discussion (debate?) between you and my co-author, Paul Jones. Colin (from WGLC comments): Rather, within a single RTP session there are RTCP packets sent that give information about the RTP streams that are being sent, and that report on the reception quality of RTP streams being received. Using a single PHB and DSCP for all RTCP packets within an RTP session might make sense, but it's important to note that one role of RTCP is to provide an estimate of the round-trip time seen by the media, so the PHB\/DSCP will have to be chosen with care to avoid biasing that estimate too much. Paul (from shortly after the Toronto meeting: During the meeting, there was discussion of marking RTCP packets. Some notes I received on this topic suggested that it was proposed that RTCP should be marked the same as for RTP. The argument was that this is used for RTT calculations. If that is what was said, I'd like to state my disagreement. :-) The forward and reverse paths are not necessarily the same and there is nothing one should assume about the reverse path to provide guidance about the forward path (or vice versa). As perhaps a gross example, I have the ability to download far faster on my home Internet connection than I can upload. Other important traffic characteristics differ in each direction. Further, an RTCP packet might provide information related to several different RTP packets. I certainly would not want to see one RTCP packet per RTP packet. I'll watch where that discussion goes before proposing text. One of the uses of RTCP is certainly to estimate the round-trip time, as described in Section 6.4.1 (page 41) of RFC 3550. The DSCP marking used for RTCP does need to take this use into account. Ideally, this would mean RTCP packets were marked the same as the corresponding RTP packets, as I suggested in the meeting. However, Paul is correct that this only works when all RTP packets have the same marking. Accordingly, I’m not sure what the right marking is for RTCP. One approach might be to say that an SSRC that sends RTP packets with different marking should use marking with the highest(lowest?) precedence of those is uses for RTCP, so the RTT estimate calculated from RTCP is representative of some RTP packets. I’m not sure that using a single DSCP for all RTCP packets would achieve that. Colin -- Colin Perkins http:\/\/csperkins.org\/"}

Title : Differentiated Services (DiffServ) and Real-time Communication Authors : David Black Paul Jones Filename : draft-ietf-dart-dscp-rtp-05.txt Pages : 27 Date : 2014-08-29 Abstract: This memo describes the interaction between Differentiated Services (DiffServ) network quality of service (QoS) functionality and real- time network communication, including communication based on the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). DiffServ is based on network nodes applying different forwarding treatments to packets whose IP headers are marked with different DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs). WebRTC applications, as well as some conferencing applications, have begun using the Session Description Protocol (SDP) bundle negotiation mechanism to send multiple traffic streams with different QoS requirements using the same network 5-tuple. Use of different DSCPs to obtain different QoS treatments within a single network 5-tuple, the results (e.g., reordering) may cause transport protocol interactions, particularly with congestion control functionality.

{"_id":"doc-en-dart-N2-PLOhoQ7ubw_7uJKe7NLnwskY","title":"","text":"Re: [Dart] DART dscp-rtp draft: Proposed RTCP text\nHere's the proposed new section 5.4, with the RTCP multi-stream reporting optimizations text moved into that new section from its current location at the end of 5.3, plus the rewritten Section 6 guideline bullet: 5.4. DiffServ and RTCP The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) [RFC3550] is used with RTP to monitor quality of service and convey information about RTP session participants. A sender of RTCP packets that also sends RTP packets (i.e., originates an RTP stream) should use the same DSCP marking for both types of packets. If an RTCP sender doesn't send any RTP packets, it should mark its RTCP packets with the DSCP that it would use if it did send RTP packets. If the RTCP sender uses or would use multiple DSCPs that differ only in drop precedence for RTP, then it should use the DSCP with the least likelihood of drop for RTCP to increase the likelihood of RTCP packet delivery. This looks okay (the correction in your next message is good also). You might also add something along the lines of “If the SDP bundle extension [cite] is used to negotiate sending multiple types of media in a single RTP session, then the receivers will send separate RTCP reports for each type of media, using a separate SSRC for each media type; those RTCP reports need to be marked with the DSCP corresponding to the type of media handled by the reporting SSRC.” This guidance may result in different DSCP markings for RTP streams and RTCP receiver reports about those RTP streams. The resulting variation in network QoS treatment by traffic direction could result in unrepresentative round trip time (RTT) estimates that don't correspond to consistent network QoS treatment in both directions. I don’t think this is a problem. The media doesn’t get consistent network QoS treatment in both directions, and the RTCP is trying to sample the RTT seen by the media, so this is fine. RTCP receiver reports may be relatively infrequent (e.g., may be sent only once per video frame rendered) and hence the resulting RTT estimates are of limited utility for congestion control (although they have other important uses, see [RFC3550]). For this reason, it is not important that RTCP receiver reports receive the same network QoS treatment as the RTP stream or streams being reported on. RTCP multi-stream reporting optimizations for an RTP session [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-multi-stream-optimisation] assume that the RTP streams involved experience the same network behavior, including packet loss. This mechanism is highly inappropriate when the RTP streams involved use different DSCPs, even if the corresponding PHBs differ solely in drop precedence. This could maybe say “received RTP streams”, since it’s okay to use the rtp-multi-stream-optimisation if you send with different DSCPs (the optimisation is optimising how you send reports about what you receive). 6. Guidelines [... snip ...] o Should use a single DSCP for RTCP packets, which should be a DSCP used for RTP packets that are or would be sent by the same sender, see Section 5.4. Perhaps “Each SSRC should use a single DSCP for RTCP … used by RTP packets that are or would be sent by that SSRC…”? Just “sender\" could be ambiguous, since an endpoint could be a sender for several streams, each of which has a separate SSRC and could use a different DSCP. -- Colin Perkins http:\/\/csperkins.org\/"}

You're one of the authors of -multi-stream, so you should be able to speak clearly to the point. Can you clarify? If I have several SSRCs, and receive several media streams, then provided each of my SSRCs sees the exact same quality for each received stream, then I can use the multi-stream-optimisation to reduce the number of RTCP cross reports I send. The multi-stream-optimisation draft says that already, and it’s not clear that the DART drafts needs to say anything further on the topic. Whether I use the same DSCP for all RTCP reports I send is, I think, orthogonal to whether I use the multi-stream-optimisation.

That's independent of the number of drop levels. My point is, if a separate DSCP is desired on egress, a separate classification for a PHB is required on ingress. If your choice is 3 DSCPs for AFx class, then the queue may be configured to produce one, two or three differing drop levels. This may be relevant for standards compliance, but not for the number of PHBs to be configured. In this thread, we seem to either explain the same thing to each other or talk past each other. Thanks for correcting my count of PHBs, I forgot EF. And yes, 7 queues for RTCweb. That's another restricted resource. Admission control must work the same way for all flows of a PHB where it is deployed. Otherwise it is pointless.

You've asked for information on what's implemented today and that's what I've provided. Each AF DSCP identifies an individual PHB. If classification is DSCP based and limits apply on the number of PHBs, that's what providers have to respect. This limit still applies, if e.g. all AF4 packets are operated by the same scheduler (which I'd expect from a provider deployment). Each AF class (2 or 3 PHBs) usually only needs a single queue. It is not allowed to map an AF class to only a single PHB: Within each AF class, a DS node MUST accept all three drop precedence codepoints and they MUST yield at least two different levels of loss probability. So at least one needs to distinguish between AFx1 and AFx2\/AFx3. It is also somewhat demanding to configure 14 PHBs to support just rtcweb on a retail access and then provide additional PHBs for services of a provider. The provider may offer some services with admission control and If you want to realize all proposed mappings of http:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/draft-ietf-tsvwg-rtcweb-qos-00 you probably need 7 separate queues (LE, BE, AF1-AF4, EF) and at most 15 DSCP to PHB mappings. if rtcweb isn't running through the same admission control, this requires additional PHBs. Some carriers may have deployed DiffServ already, when rtcweb starts to use it. I think that you'll need admission control for EF and AFx1 PHBs otherwise you'll end up with best-effort behavior in overload situations...

Gorry Here's the next to last paragraph in Section 5.3: SCTP [RFC4960] differs from TCP in a number of ways, including the ability to deliver messages in an order that differs from the order in which they were sent and support for unreliable streams. However, SCTP performs congestion control and retransmission across the entire association, and not on a per-stream basis. Although there may be advantages to using multiple drop precedence across SCTP streams or within an SCTP stream that does not use reliable ordered delivery, there is no practical operational experience in doing so (e.g., the SCTP sockets API [RFC6458] does not support use of more than one DSCP for an SCTP association). As a consequence, the impacts on SCTP protocol and implementation behavior are unknown and difficult to predict. Hence a single PHB and DSCP should be used for all packets in an SCTP association, independent of the number or nature of streams in that association. Similar reasoning applies to a DCCP connection; a single PHB and DSCP should be used because the scope of congestion control is the connection and there is no operational experience with using more than one PHB or DSCP. I propose to add the following new sentence as its own paragraph: Guidance on transport protocol design and implementation to provide support for use of multiple PHBs and DSCPs in a transport connection (e.g., DCCP) or association (e.g., SCTP) is out of scope for this document.

Gorry Hi Gorry, the following text will likely appear in the next version of my diffserv-intercon draft. The more DSCPs appear in a flow which aren't deployed end-to-end for the corresponding PHB, the more often one of the scenarios will be encountered. The following scenarios start from a domain sending IP traffic using a PHB and a corresponding DSCP to an interconnected domain. The receiving domain may - Support the PHB and offer the same corresponding DSCP - Not support the PHB and use the DSCP for a different PHB - Not support the PHB and not use the DSCP - Support the PHB with a differing DSCP, and the DSCP of the sending domain is not used for another PHB - Support the PHB with a differing DSCP, and the DSCP of the sending domain is used for another PHB Another question to be answered then is how a network provider will treat unrecognized or unexpected DSCPs received at network boundaries.

The four bullet points in Section 2.1 that follow \"The RTCWEB protocol suit encompasses a number of forms of multiplexing\" seem to confuse RTP sessions, RTCP, and transport-layer flows. I suggest they be changed to: The RTP streams that comprise a WebRTC session can be multiplexed together in a number of ways: 1. Individual source streams are carried in one or more individual RTP streams. These RTP streams can be multiplexed onto a single transport-layer flow or sent as separate transport-layer flows. This memo only considers the case where the RTP streams are to be multiplexed onto a single transport-layer flow, forming a single RTP session; 2. The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) [RFC3550] may be multiplexed onto the same transport-layer flow as the RTP stream with which it is associated, as described in [RFC5761], or it may be sent on a separate transport-layer flow; 3. The RTP and RTCP traffic can be multiplexed with other protocols via UDP encapsulation over a common pair of UDP ports as described in [RFC5764] as updated by [I-D.petithuguenin-avtcore-rfc5764-mux-fixes]; and Can we clarify what \"other protocols\" are expected? Are we just talking about WebRTC data-channels over SCTP\/DTLS, or other things? If the latter, are we talking things we expect to do today, or in immediate futures, or extensions that might happen someday? 4. The data may be further encapsulated via STUN [RFC5389] and TURN [RFC5766] for NAT (Network Address Translator) traversal. In the following paragraph (penultimate paragraph in Section 2.1), I suggest changing \"unidirectional UDP packet flow\" to \"transport-layer flow\" since it will not be unidirectional (since RTCP also flows in the reverse direction), and might not use UDP. In the first paragraph of section 2.2, I suggest changing \"multiplexed over RTP sessions\" to \"multiplexed in a single RTP session\" and \"multiplexing of source streams in RTP sessions\" to \"multiplexing of source streams in a single RTP session\". In Section 6, the second bullet point refers to \"an RTCP session\". There is no such thing. Rather, within a single RTP session there are RTCP packets sent that give information about the RTP streams that are being sent, and that report on the reception quality of RTP streams being received. Using a single PHB and DSCP for all RTCP packets within an RTP session might make sense, but it's important to note that one role of RTCP is to provide an estimate of the round-trip time seen by the media, so the PHB\/DSCP will have to be chosen with care to avoid biasing that estimate too much. Editorial: the protocol is called WebRTC, but the working group is RTCWEB. Accordingly, I think all instances of \"RTCWEB\" in this draft need to change to \"WebRTC\". Cheers, Colin Hi, The DART working group has started a last call for draft-ietf-dart-dscp- rtp-02, ending on August 22.

This is really a comment on draft-ietf-tsvwg-rtcweb-qos, but I think the discussion should perhaps start here. draft-ietf-tsvwg-rtcweb-qos is aligned with a subset of RFC 4594, which is entirely reasonable since the update of that RFC seems to be on hold. However, in terms of what DSCPs have a good chance of actually crossing ISP boundaries in one piece, I think we should also look at draft-geib-tsvwg-diffserv-intercon. The main issue is that draft-geib suggests a quite small set of DSCPs that would hypothetically cross boundaries.

If a MediaStream is carried in a RTP session, the text may also explicitely say that (it says MediaStreamTrack == media flow, which is carried in an individual RTP packet stream) As I read Section 11 of draft-ietf-rtcweb-rtp-usage-15, for RTCWEB, that would happen only when the MediaStream contains exactly one MediaStreamTrack. The use of these terms in bullet item 1 in section 2 is intended to be specific to RTCWEB, but we could add text elsewhere to point out that non-RTCWEB usage of MediaStreams could use an RTP packet stream for each Media Stream, independent of how many MediaStreamTracks each MediaStream contains. Could you suggest a reference that could be cited for usage of an RTP packet stream for each MediaStream independent of how many MediaStreamTracks each MediaStream contains? Careful - \"RTP packet stream\" is one of those concepts that can be meaningless without citing a specific definition. draft-ietf-avtext-rtp-grouping-taxonomy is probably the best reference at the moment. It says this about \"Packet stream\": 2.1.10. Packet Stream A stream of RTP packets containing media data, source or redundant. The Packet Stream is identified by an SSRC belonging to a particular RTP session. The RTP session is identified as discussed in Section 2.2.2. Under this definition, it's impossible to put more than one MediaStreamTrack into a packet stream. In a lot of cases (FEC, redundancy, SVC, simulcast), there will be multiple RTP packet streams associated with one MediaStreamTrack. The term is used only once in the draft, but unfortunately defines a new term to mean the same thing: The most common protocol used for real time media is the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP)[RFC3550]. RTP defines the mechanism by which real-time data is transmitted between hosts on the Internet. With most applications, a single media type (e.g., audio) is transmitted within a single RTP session. However, it is possible to transmit multiple, distinct media flows over the same RTP session as individual RTP packet streams. This is referred to as RTP multiplexing. For the purposes of this draft, the term \"media flow\" refers to a sequence of packets that is transmitted as a single RTP packet stream. The term \"media flow\" doesn't sound to me like a good term to use for this concept. Would the authors be willing to consider switching to \"packet stream\"?"}

There's one change I'd like to suggest: Section 3.1, list number 2. briefly explains AF. The section doesn't explicitly mention that traffic carried by one of the three PHBs of an AF class are not reordered. This feature, avoiding reordering packets belonging to different PHBs of an AF class, is however a kind of punch line whenever AF is referred to in later sections. So I'd welcome mentioning it in section 3.1, list point 2. ################# minor comments (no objection if ignored) ############################# Section 4. , second block. Why are I-frames marked AF41 and P-frames AF43 in the example? To me, AF42 for P makes more sense (or make it AF42 for I frames). AF43 could be used for B-frames (which aren't mentioned in the text). Section 5.1 second block after the bullet pointed list \".making reordering very likely.\" Would \"making reordering likely\" be sufficient? Section 5.1 There's at least one ECMP implementation I'm aware of which includes QoS bits to calculate the load balancing hash value. It reorders packets of a flow using multiple classes, if they are spaced less than the resulting delay difference. This is an exceptional implementation, the other solutions I'm aware of do ignore QoS bits when calculating ECMP hash values. ECMP is a proprietary feature, I think. And one editorial comment: Section 3., last bullet point and following section: the bullet point is focused on Lower Effort PHB marked by CS 1 and the following section continues by discussing CS 1 issues more general. This discussion may be added to the bullet point (to me the discussion doesn't seem to be related to the first bullet point). ######################################################## Sorry for being late with my review.

The question coming to my mind is, whether your team can add a statement how many AF classes are useful to carry different RTP sessions within one UDP flow.

Title : Differentiated Services (DiffServ) and Real-time Communication Authors : Dan York David Black Cullen Jennings Paul Jones Filename : draft-york-dart-dscp-rtp-00.txt Pages : 13 Date : 2014-06-06 Abstract: This document describes the interaction between Differentiated Services (DiffServ) network quality of service (QoS) functionality and real-time network communication, including communication based on the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). DiffServ is based on network nodes applying different forwarding treatments to packets whose IP headers are marked with different DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs). As a result, use of different DSCPs within a single traffic flow may cause transport protocol interactions (e.g., due to reordering). In addition, DSCP markings may be changed or removed between the traffic source and destination. This document covers the implications of these DiffServ aspects for real-time network communication, including RTCWEB.

Yes, something definitely needs to be done, as shaping excess traffic is not consistent with the EF service. In addition, RFC 3246 recommends against (SHOULD NOT) remarking EF traffic within a DS domain in one of the text excerpts that was in your email, so remarking should not be mentioned as a possibility.

I've copied in some text of RFC3246 related to EF remarking and policing below. My take: . remarking of entire flows is an option, but no remarking of packets exceeding EF capacity limits. - looking at the EF jitter and delay properties, I doubt that shaping is desirable. RFC3246 doesn't mention shaping as part of EF conditioning. I personally wouldn't expect EF shaping in sections where policing is applied. - dropping of packets exceeding EF capacity is a MUST, if I interpret RFC3246 correctly. I suggest to adapt the section of draft-dart-dscp to be more precise regarding the optional remarking of EF traffic and to remove shaping as a conditioning option if traffic is beyond the EF forwarding capacity limit. A Proposal for the final sentence: ...exceeds that capacity must be dropped. EF compliant flows may be remarked to a different DSCP. All other new text indicated by the Diff version looks allright. Regards, Ruediger draft-dart-dscp: 3. Expedited Forwarding (EF) [RFC3246] intended for inelastic traffic.

Packets marked for EF PHB MAY be remarked at a DS domain boundary only to other codepoints that satisfy the EF PHB. Packets marked for EF PHBs SHOULD NOT be demoted or promoted to another PHB by a DS domain. If the EF PHB is implemented by a mechanism that allows unlimited preemption of other traffic (e.g., a priority queue), the implementation MUST include some means to limit the damage EF traffic could inflict on other traffic (e.g., a token bucket rate limiter). Traffic that exceeds this limit MUST be discarded. -----Ursprüngliche Nachricht----- Von: Dart [mailto:dart-bounces@ietf.org] Im Auftrag von Ben Campbell Gesendet: Samstag, 9.

Anyway, I do try to track thinking in this area in the ongoing development of cerowrt's sqm system, which has pluggable modules for all the known aqm and fq schedulers, and a three tier system modeled on wondershaper for managing traffic, which uses what diffserv markings that I have observed make sense... Some relevant links: http:\/\/www.bufferbloat.net\/projects\/cerowrt\/wiki\/Wondershaper_Must_Die http:\/\/www.bufferbloat.net\/projects\/cerowrt\/wiki\/Setting_up_SQM_for_CeroWrt_310 http:\/\/www.bufferbloat.net\/projects\/cerowrt\/wiki\/Smart_Queue_Management Missing from this discussion so far is what is actually deployed out there... I am only familiar with stuff like the above as an egress\/ingress queue management system... AND: in the case of linux based wireless routers, none of the AF codepoints are respected explicitly, and how the codepoints are mapped are described by 802.11e - and that is far more about scheduling priority for airtime rather than drop probability. It is kind of hard to wrap your head around how 802.11e actually works, but, this is a start: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/IEEE_802.11e-2005#Enhanced_distributed_channel_access_.28EDCA.29 In linux wifi at least: CS0, CS3 are mapped into the BE hw queue CS1, CS2 are mapped into the BK hw queue CS4, CS5 are mapped into the VI hw queue CS6, CS7 are mapped into the VO hw queue Bit patterns for the other classes to whatever extent they map into CSX are mapped into the underlying hardware queue. I am not saying this is an optimal state of affairs, (as notably VO should be as completely disabled as possible in the 802.11n and ac age), and am very interested in how other OSes (ios, osx, windows), and router\/switch OSes do it, but the wireless scheduling aspect of all these codepoints does not seem to be well touched upon. On a personal note I tend to think that having 17+ ways to slice up traffic is about 13 or 14 too many, particularly those targetting a drop probability. When you have drop rates well below a few percentage points, adding another percentage point of granularity seems futile. Lastly, there is also an implementation issue in linux presently in that doing extensive diffserv classification basically requires one iptables or tc rule per class, which is inefficient.

Maybe just delete \"the results (e.g., reordering)\"? Likewise for the same phrase in the introduction.Introduction:\"\"\" (Section 7 is an empty IANA Considerations section)\"\"\"Note to future self: Remove this parenthetical and renumber once this hits the RFC Editor.Section 5.1:\"\"\" In general, marking packets with different DSCPs results in different PHBs being applied at nodes in the network, making reordering possible due to use of different pools of forwarding resources for each PHB.\"\"\"This seems like a pretty import, so I would state it more strongly. It doesn't just make reordering possible, it makes it much more likely. (This is the flip side of the Section 6 comment above.)"}

The problem is that the way the WebRTC APIs are structured, it's not necessarily clear to an application that its media traffic is indeed going over TCP, so it might make precedence requests that the browser implementing the APIs can't (and shouldn't try to) satisfy. The question is how the browser should behave when that happens. I spoke to Cullen about this, offline, after the DART session, and I believe he had a simple proposal. Jonathan, Let's briefly discuss your point below: Different drop precedences are required if congestion within a PHB group may occur. TCP is designed for reliable transport. In case of a loss, TCP will reduce bandwidth and retransmit the dropped information. I'm not an RTP expert. The few applications known to me don't seem to benefit from such a behavior, if a single application flow uses different drop precedence levels in combination with TCP. It may make sense to have different TCP flows marked by different drop precedences. The less important TCP flows get throttled in the case of congestion. But is there a need to avoid re-ordering across different drop precedences, which is an AF PHB group feature? Again, I'm not an RTP expert - but that doesn't sound like making a lot of sense too. In general, I'd be interested to learn, if some applications were benefitting from ECN (or a congestion indication by marking rather than by dropping). Independent from the question whether they use TCP or RTP transport.

ICE, effectively (in the modes used for RTP and the like, i.e. as used in WebRTC-style contexts), presents an API as though it’s sending datagrams. However, because ICE includes TCP candidates (both ICE-TCP and TURN-TCP), sometimes this “datagram\" traffic will end up actually going over TCP instead, and depending on your implementation this will often be invisible to the higher-level code. When this happens, it would be a bad thing if the low-level per-packet DSCP markings you were trying to use on UDP were applied to the TCP connection. Even beyond the usual problems with mixing DSCP markings on a TCP connection, these framed TCP streams are usually created in userspace, so the packetization you expected from your API won’t be the packetization of the TCP on the wire.

{"_id":"doc-en-dart-_Hp2TyUupTpLC55NdsSvnFflYuA","title":"","text":"[Dart] Comments on draft-ietf-tsvwg-rtcweb-qos-00\nHi, some remarks on draft-ietf-tsvwg-rtcweb-qos-00: Sec. 2: The mitigation for such action is through an authorization mechanism. An authorization mechanism alone is probably not sufficient, because DS boundary nodes may need to police (e.g., remark\/drop) incoming traffic according to some agreed\/negotiated traffic profile for some of the PHBs, e.g., the EF PHB does not work properly if its traffic class is overloaded (see below). Sec. 4: The below uses the concept of a media flow, however these are commonly not equivalent to a transport flow, i.e. as defined by a 5-tuple (source address, destination address, source port, destination port, and protocol). I think one should try to use definitions that do not depend on the classifier type like 5-tuple, because as Brian already mentioned, for IPv6 a 3-tuple (IPsrc, IPdst, Flow Label) may be sufficient and header fields of the 5-tuple are not always accessible. I liked the definition of microflow in DiffServ as being an application-to-application flow of packets, usually being identified by that well known 5-tuple. For elements within the network microflows are usually the most fine grained distinction level for flows (except when you apply multi-field classifier that do some DPI and add the SSRC etc.). (nit: is probably a word like \"text\" missing in the first cited sentence above?) Proper definitions for media flow, RTP session, transport flow etc. may help to avoid confusion, so maybe one could try to combine efforts with draft-york-dart-dscp-rtp-00? Sec. 5: SHOULD use these values to mark the appropriate media packets. More information on EF can be found in [RFC3246]. More information on AF can be found in [RFC2597]. The problem with using EF is that if too many EF marked packets are injected into a DS domain, they probably void the EF properties for other users within this domain (background is that the service rate of EF packets on a given output interface must exceed their arrival rate at that interface over long and short time intervals - this is usually checked by admission control before use and policing at DS boundary nodes during use). Therefore, maybe some discussion w.r.t. RFC5865 http:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc5865 may be useful. The above table assumes that packets marked with CS1 is treated as \"less than best effort\". However, the treatment of CS1 is implementation dependent. If an implementation treats CS1 as other than \"less than best effort\", then the priority of the packets may be changed from what is intended. BTW, there is no \"less than best effort\" PHB defined, but a Lower Effort Per-Domain Behavior (PDB) in RFC 3662 (http:\/\/tools.ietf.org \/html\/rfc3662). This RFC is also the source for the recommendation of using the CS-1 codepoint for that purpose, so you may considering referencing it. If a packet enters a QoS domain that has no support for the above defined Data Types\/Application (service) classes, then the network node at the edge will remark the DSCP value based on policies. Yes, but even if there is support for these classes traffic conditioning (e.g., remarking\/dropping etc.) may be necessary and applied. Remarking to different PHBs may also lead to packet reordering within a media flow?! Regards, Roland"}

Packets with different markings can be reordered, which can cause poor interaction with a transport protocol that is sensitive to reordering. When RTP streams or other real-time media (sub-)flows are used with different DSCP values with the same transport 5-tuple, there may be transport protocol interactions. There are also environments where the DSCP markings are removed or remarked. This WG will write a document that explains the limitations that exist with DiffServ when used with RTP in general as well in the specific RTCWeb cases. The WG will coordinate with relevant WGs, including TSVWG, AVTCORE, MMUSIC, CLUE, RTCWEB, and RMCAT.

The question is how the browser should behave when that happens. I spoke to Cullen about this, offline, after the DART session, and I believe he had a simple proposal. What would we expect DART to say about this? It seems to me that we should point out that we think different drop precedences for a single TCP connections doesn't make sense. But it is RTCWEB's issue to think things through if they have a use case that might make this happen, isn't it? Maybe not for dart, but for turn: tunnel the drop precedence through turn so it can be applied on the other end??? Thanks, Paul"}

Please feel free to leave the existing text alone if these suggestions don't help. At the end of page 13, the sentence that starts \"Transport protocol support for multiple\"... is very long and hard to parse. I suspect it will be hard to translate. The action of changing the existing protocols is implied rather than explicit in the current wording. \"current designs\" is vague. I suggest this as a starting point: \"Adding support for multiple QoS-based traffic classes within a single network 5-tuple to a transport protocol adds significant complexity compared to the current protocol definitions. For congestion-controlled transport protocols, network congestion information for each QoS-based traffic class would have to be disambiguated to allow congestion control to be managed separately for each such traffic class.\" Hopefully it can be made even simpler. In the first paragraph of 5.2, would \"Such reordering may lead to unneeded retransmission, and spurious emission of retransmission control signals (such as NACK) in reliable delivery protocols (see Section 5.1)\" work?"}

The use of these terms in bullet item 1 in DB: section 2 is intended to be specific to RTCWEB, but we could add DB: text elsewhere to point out that non-RTCWEB usage of MediaStreams DB: could use an RTP packet stream for each Media Stream, independent DB: of how many MediaStreamTracks each MediaStream contains.

DB: OTOH, we did put this warning text in at the end of Section 2.4 of draft- york: Backbone and other carrier networks may employ a small number of DSCPs (e.g., less than half a dozen) in order to manage a small number of traffic aggregates; hosts that use a larger number of DSCPs may find that much of the intended differentiation is removed by such networks.

RG> tsvwg-rtcweb-qos offers 4 priorities which, following the definition given there, are relevant to the browser (not to forwarding, as the draft doesn't change existing standards on that). I'd expect priorities \"very low\" and \"low\" to be produced in one queue. I'd expect each AF class to be produced in one queue. So packet reordering may occur between different priorities. Type \"data\" requires 3 queues, if produced as I'd assume. RG> Your draft is offering good QoS related guidance, and it's not only provided by the above section.

I'd further appreciate, if all rtcweb related drafts in the transport area clarify the concepts they support related to rtcweb transport flow types. MF based classification is one mode of DiffServ operation and it's important to note whether this is applicable in future or not. For the time being, application servers aren't always marking flows and the above suggests, that they will have to mark packets within flows individually. RG> Finally, if the QoE suffers because code points interpreted as application priorities by browsers, which at the same time are interpreted as transport QoS marks by routers which may be changed at network boundaries, then DiffServ as a whole may have to be re-thought.

Or more generally relate to the fact that media streams within the same congestion control context cannot be handled individually. Right now such considerations are not in the document. If the intention is for such consideration to come in documents from the dart wg, then it would be very important to have a reference to this dependency - or ? IMHO, such a reference is necessary, although the dart WG draft will be informational. The reference should be added once there is an official dart WG draft (likely to happen this week). Something else: Right now the document stipulates that packets within the same media stream may be marked with different DSCP codepoints, i.e., it is said: One may select difference drop precedences for the different packets in the media flow. Therefore, all packets in the stream SHOULD be marked with the same priority but can have difference drop precedences. which indeed is in compliance with the recommendations put forward in draft-york-dart-dscp-rtp-00 in that it ensures that the DSCP markings do not result in re-ordering within the media flow, but has it been ascertained, from a CC perspective that usage of different drop precedence within the same CC context is viable ? Good question - I will include that in my slides for the dart WG meeting. From the RTCWEB data channel perspective this certainly isn't viable (being SCTP based), whether it is viable from an RMCAT CC perspective is something that we in the RMCAT wg would need to make more clear. What's the rationale for \"certainly isn't viable\" regarding different drop precedences within a single SCTP session? [Karen] Ok - \"certainly not viable\" is too strong formulation. Having different drop precedences within the same SCTP CC context would, given that SCTP CC presently is drop driven only, results in that the whole data channel is impacted, from a CC perspective, by the highest drop precedence.

[Karen] Ok - \"certainly not viable\" is too strong formulation. Having different drop precedences within the same SCTP CC context would, given that SCTP CC presently is drop driven only, results in that the whole data channel is impacted, from a CC perspective, by the highest drop precedence. But I realize that whether this is acceptable is a question indeed. I think you're on to something here. If the drop precedences only came into play after the decision to drop a packet had been made, their effect would probably be minimal, as they would only affect what to drop in a session, not how much to drop. OTOH, DiffServ AF is not intended to operate in that fashion - the rationale for the 3 drop precedences per AF class was based on envisioning the output of two-threshold rate shaper: AFx1 - Within base or committed traffic profile AFx2 - Beyond base\/committed, but within excess or burst traffic profile AFx3 - Completely out of profile Hence the relative mix of those drop precedences can be expected to affect the overall drop rate\/probability seen in a session where those precedences are mixed.

I doubt the RTT estimate derived from RTCP is used for congestion control, since it’s too infrequent to get insight into the dynamics. It’s for user experience reporting, maybe rough clustering of receivers, that sort of thing. I'd agree if I didn't have the impression, in RMCAT, that nothing but RTP \/ RTCP is allowed?!

I want to hit one particular comment: [...] \"SCTP ... can be multiplexed with one or more RTP sessions\". Actually we can only multiplex SCTP with a single RTP session. There have been proposals that would allow multiplexing of multiple RTP sessions (each containing multiple media flows) over a single 5-tuple, but these were not accepted. [...] In bullet 2, only one RTP session can be multiplexed with another transport protocol (again). [...] Is this a matter of proper definitions of \"RTP Session\" vs \"Media Flow\"? (i.e. properly naming the thing that can be multiplexed?) Or is there a technical misunderstanding? Ben. The word \"session\" is one of the most horrible words in the vocabulary..... RTP packet streams that are in the same RTP session can be multiplexed over the same 5-tuple. RTP packet streams that are from different RTP sessions cannot. A media flow as you've defined it here (=\"packet stream\" from -taxonomy-) is identified by its SSRC. About \"RTP Session\", -taxonomy- has this definition: 2.2.2. RTP Session An RTP session is an association among a group of participants communicating with RTP. It is a group communications channel which can potentially carry a number of Packet Streams. Within an RTP session, every participant can find meta-data and control information (over RTCP) about all the Packet Streams in the RTP session. The bandwidth of the RTCP control channel is shared between all participants within an RTP Session. Alternate usages: o Within the context of SDP, a singe m=line can map to a single RTP Session or multiple m=lines can map to a single RTP Session. The latter is enabled via multiplexing schemes such as BUNDLE [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation], for example, which allows mapping of multiple m=lines to a single RTP Session. Characteristics: o Typically, an RTP Session can carry one ore more Packet Streams. o An RTP Session shares a single SSRC space as defined in RFC3550 [RFC3550]. That is, the End Points participating in an RTP Session can see an SSRC identifier transmitted by any of the other End Points. An End Point can receive an SSRC either as SSRC or as a Contributing source (CSRC) in RTP and RTCP packets, as defined by the endpoints' network interconnection topology. o An RTP Session uses at least two Media Transports (Section 2.1.13), one for sending and one for receiving. Commonly, the receiving one is the reverse direction of the same one as used for sending. An RTP Session may use many Media Transports and these define the session's network interconnection topology. A single Media Transport can normally not transport more than one RTP Session, unless a solution for multiplexing multiple RTP sessions over a single Media Transport is used. One example of such a scheme is Multiple RTP Sessions on a Single Lower-Layer Transport [I-D.westerlund-avtcore-transport-multiplexing]. o Multiple RTP Sessions can be related. About the possibility of putting multiple sessions on a single media transport, -taxonomy- says: 3.4. Multiple RTP Sessions over one Media Transport [I-D.westerlund-avtcore-transport-multiplexing] describes a mechanism that allow several RTP Sessions to be carried over a single underlying Media Transport. The main reasons for doing this are related to the impact of using one or more Media Transports. Thus using a common network path or potentially have different ones. There is reduced need for NAT\/FW traversal resources and no need for flow based QoS. However, Multiple RTP Sessions over one Media Transport makes it clear that a single Media Transport 5-tuple is not sufficient to express which RTP Session context a particular Packet Stream exists in. Complexities in the relationship between Media Transports and RTP Session already exist as one RTP Session contains multiple Media Transports, e.g. even a Peer-to-Peer RTP Session with RTP\/RTCP Multiplexing requires two Media Transports, one in each direction. The relationship between Media Transports and RTP Sessions as well as additional levels of identifiers need to be considered in both signaling design and when defining terminology. This is, in my opinion, a very longwinded way of saying \"this doesn't exist\". The -westerlund- draft expired this April. I have not heard of anyone pursuing it."}

The four bullet points in Section 2.1 that follow \"The RTCWEB protocol suit encompasses a number of forms of multiplexing\" seem to confuse RTP sessions, RTCP, and transport-layer flows. I suggest they be changed to: The RTP streams that comprise a WebRTC session can be multiplexed together in a number of ways: 1. Individual source streams are carried in one or more individual RTP streams. These RTP streams can be multiplexed onto a single transport-layer flow or sent as separate transport-layer flows. This memo only considers the case where the RTP streams are to be multiplexed onto a single transport-layer flow, forming a single RTP session; 2. The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) [RFC3550] may be multiplexed onto the same transport-layer flow as the RTP stream with which it is associated, as described in [RFC5761], or it may be sent on a separate transport-layer flow; 3. The RTP and RTCP traffic can be multiplexed with other protocols via UDP encapsulation over a common pair of UDP ports as described in [RFC5764] as updated by [I-D.petithuguenin-avtcore-rfc5764-mux-fixes]; and Can we clarify what \"other protocols\" are expected? Are we just talking about WebRTC data-channels over SCTP\/DTLS, or other things? If the latter, are we talking things we expect to do today, or in immediate futures, or extensions that might happen someday? 4. The data may be further encapsulated via STUN [RFC5389] and TURN [RFC5766] for NAT (Network Address Translator) traversal. In the following paragraph (penultimate paragraph in Section 2.1), I suggest changing \"unidirectional UDP packet flow\" to \"transport-layer flow\" since it will not be unidirectional (since RTCP also flows in the reverse direction), and might not use UDP. In the first paragraph of section 2.2, I suggest changing \"multiplexed over RTP sessions\" to \"multiplexed in a single RTP session\" and \"multiplexing of source streams in RTP sessions\" to \"multiplexing of source streams in a single RTP session\". In Section 6, the second bullet point refers to \"an RTCP session\". There is no such thing. Rather, within a single RTP session there are RTCP packets sent that give information about the RTP streams that are being sent, and that report on the reception quality of RTP streams being received. Using a single PHB and DSCP for all RTCP packets within an RTP session might make sense, but it's important to note that one role of RTCP is to provide an estimate of the round-trip time seen by the media, so the PHB\/DSCP will have to be chosen with care to avoid biasing that estimate too much. Editorial: the protocol is called WebRTC, but the working group is RTCWEB. Accordingly, I think all instances of \"RTCWEB\" in this draft need to change to \"WebRTC\". Cheers, Colin Hi, The DART working group has started a last call for draft-ietf-dart-dscp- rtp-02, ending on August 22.

In an ideal world, I would argue that RTCP packets should be marked with whatever DSCP value will deliver RTCP packets in the most expedient way. Since we don't have an ideal world, I don't know which DSCP value that would be. Would the starting positions of \"getting feedback is important, even of not for RTT estimates\" and \"we need RTCP for RTT estimates\" likely land on the same guidance for DSCP values? The argument to send RTCP packets in the most expedient way sounds reasonable. I don't know if we need to recommend a particular DSCP, since we already have quite a bit of text on how DSCPs might (or might not) map into some predictable PHB treatment. Good question and valid point. Nowhere in the document do we recommend the use of a particular DSCP value for any particular thing, and we should not recommend a particular value for RTCP in this document. I'm just not sure what statements should be made. I suspect we can all agree that RTCP information is important. It's just the DSCP-related guidance that goes with that that is challenging. I don't agree that RTCP information should be sent as higher priority than the media. Ideally, it should be sent with the same priority as the media, so it can be used to sample the RTT. This RTT sample is independent of RMCAT. It's in base RTP specification, and so is something we need to support to the extent possible. Since not all the media sent by a single SSRC has the same marking, my suggestion would be that each SSRC mark the RTCP packets it sends with one of the same code points as it uses to mark the media. Since RTCP is somewhat important, it would make sense for each SSRC to mark the RTCP packets it sends using the highest priority code point it uses to mark the RTP media packets it sends. That makes sense to me. Paul, and others, do you agree with that last paragraph? I agree that the value should be one of the values used for media, but the challenge is specifying which DSCP value to use. If audio is sent using EF, video as AF41, app sharing video as AF31, etc., which of these does the endpoint choose to use for RTCP? Such an endpoint will have three SSRC values, and will mark the RTCP packets sent by each SSRC in the same way as the media packets sent by that SSRC. That is, the RTCP relating to the audio will be marked EF, the RTCP relating to the video will be marked AF41, and the RTCP relating to the application sharing video will be marked AF31. The RTCP packets for each stream are sent separately, so this case seems straight-forward. The more difficult case is when an SSRC is sending video using different markings for RTP packets carrying the I- and P-frames. Should that SSRC then mark its RTCP packets like the RTP packets carrying I-frames, like the RTP packets carrying P-frames, or what? Colin Since DSCP values cannot be assumed to any particular PHB behavior in the network, that makes answering that question challenging. My personal preference in a voice\/video conference would be to use the same marking as is used for those flows -- and I would use the same value for both voice and video. However, if the app sharing video is considered more important by some applications, perhaps that's the value that should be used in those applications. I can accept the suggestion, leaving the specific selection as an implementation matter. I do wish there was something more concrete so that two devices would always follow the same approach to selecting a value, but I doubt we can get agreement very quickly.

I want to hit one particular comment: [...] \"SCTP ... can be multiplexed with one or more RTP sessions\". Actually we can only multiplex SCTP with a single RTP session. There have been proposals that would allow multiplexing of multiple RTP sessions (each containing multiple media flows) over a single 5-tuple, but these were not accepted. [...] In bullet 2, only one RTP session can be multiplexed with another transport protocol (again). [...] Is this a matter of proper definitions of \"RTP Session\" vs \"Media Flow\"? (i.e. properly naming the thing that can be multiplexed?) Or is there a technical misunderstanding? Ben. The word \"session\" is one of the most horrible words in the vocabulary..... RTP packet streams that are in the same RTP session can be multiplexed over the same 5-tuple. RTP packet streams that are from different RTP sessions cannot. A media flow as you've defined it here (=\"packet stream\" from -taxonomy-) is identified by its SSRC. About \"RTP Session\", -taxonomy- has this definition: 2.2.2. RTP Session An RTP session is an association among a group of participants communicating with RTP. It is a group communications channel which can potentially carry a number of Packet Streams. Within an RTP session, every participant can find meta-data and control information (over RTCP) about all the Packet Streams in the RTP session. The bandwidth of the RTCP control channel is shared between all participants within an RTP Session. Alternate usages: o Within the context of SDP, a singe m=line can map to a single RTP Session or multiple m=lines can map to a single RTP Session. The latter is enabled via multiplexing schemes such as BUNDLE [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation], for example, which allows mapping of multiple m=lines to a single RTP Session. Characteristics: o Typically, an RTP Session can carry one ore more Packet Streams. o An RTP Session shares a single SSRC space as defined in RFC3550 [RFC3550]. That is, the End Points participating in an RTP Session can see an SSRC identifier transmitted by any of the other End Points. An End Point can receive an SSRC either as SSRC or as a Contributing source (CSRC) in RTP and RTCP packets, as defined by the endpoints' network interconnection topology. o An RTP Session uses at least two Media Transports (Section 2.1.13), one for sending and one for receiving. Commonly, the receiving one is the reverse direction of the same one as used for sending. An RTP Session may use many Media Transports and these define the session's network interconnection topology. A single Media Transport can normally not transport more than one RTP Session, unless a solution for multiplexing multiple RTP sessions over a single Media Transport is used. One example of such a scheme is Multiple RTP Sessions on a Single Lower-Layer Transport [I-D.westerlund-avtcore-transport-multiplexing]. o Multiple RTP Sessions can be related. About the possibility of putting multiple sessions on a single media transport, -taxonomy- says: 3.4. Multiple RTP Sessions over one Media Transport [I-D.westerlund-avtcore-transport-multiplexing] describes a mechanism that allow several RTP Sessions to be carried over a single underlying Media Transport. The main reasons for doing this are related to the impact of using one or more Media Transports. Thus using a common network path or potentially have different ones. There is reduced need for NAT\/FW traversal resources and no need for flow based QoS. However, Multiple RTP Sessions over one Media Transport makes it clear that a single Media Transport 5-tuple is not sufficient to express which RTP Session context a particular Packet Stream exists in. Complexities in the relationship between Media Transports and RTP Session already exist as one RTP Session contains multiple Media Transports, e.g. even a Peer-to-Peer RTP Session with RTP\/RTCP Multiplexing requires two Media Transports, one in each direction. The relationship between Media Transports and RTP Sessions as well as additional levels of identifiers need to be considered in both signaling design and when defining terminology. This is, in my opinion, a very longwinded way of saying \"this doesn't exist\". The -westerlund- draft expired this April.

It’s for user experience reporting, maybe rough clustering of receivers, that sort of thing. I'd agree if I didn't have the impression, in RMCAT, that nothing but RTP \/ RTCP is allowed?! So can we send extra packets to probe for the RTT? I’d expect RMCAT will probe the one-way delay variation by measuring the arrival times of RTP packets, and report that in RTCP once per video frame (or so). That would give a much more accurate measurement than a single-packet sample of the RTT derived from RTCP, and would still allow per-frame adaptation. I agree that this is a useful signal to use - but I think you still need a rough idea of the RTT to be able to interoperate with TCP, else you may cause TCP to go into RTOs and be ignorant of that. But this could perhaps be a more coarse signal - maybe that's okay. I think this is reasonable. You have the RTT estimate, irrespective of the other information you include along with the regular RTCP packets, although it’s relatively infrequent and coarse-grained. I wonder if your RTCP draft in RMCAT should clarify this?

This makes sense from an economical point of view, but limits deployments to the minimum common denominator. - to configure a PHB, there are classifiers, policers, schedulers, AQM and re-markers. Implementations differ to some aspects (e.g. on supported number of classes and ingress\/egress remarking). Limits like less than 20 PHBs may apply today. I'd be interested, whether there are offers of any complete AF class as part of a single product. - there used to be a possibility to ignore the lower DSCP bits 3-6, but there's no standard to that. Some vendors removed this option and with IPv6, each PHB must be classified and completely configured individually by DSCP. Please be aware, if it comes to a re-write, a single DSCP is set for all incoming DSCPs matching this PHB. Keep in mind the possible restrictions on the number of PHBs. - many IP\/MPLS backbone networks and also many Ethernet based access networks support 3-4 PHBs for retail services. I'm not aware of any two providers using exactly the same DSCPs. I'm also not aware of any two standards using fully matching DSCPs for their PHBs (IETF, GSMA, MEF). - There's something I'd call enterprise philosophy, that is making use of a large set of internal PHBs. I never saw any of these philosophies remotely resembling the other. PHBs or classes are used to identify products, access types, stream types and so on. These usually just consume PHBs with sometimes at best loose relation to standards. If end-to-end DiffServ PHBs are what you look for, standardise what is really required and be clear on how to use it. If a network provider is expected to support these PHBs, there must be a convincing reason to do so. Take EF as an example for a well specified DiffServ standard.

Since a receiver will demux incoming packets via the SSRC, it seems the PT values associated with a given SSRC could be distinct from another SSRC. Presently for a given sender, there is a \"global\" definition of PT values (96 for some specific audio format, 97 for some specific video format, ...) and those can be used by multiple SSRCs. So I'm asking why we don't allow {SSRC1: (96, 97), SSRC2: (96, 97), ...}, where each 96 could be different formats. What would be the virtue of doing that? -Ekr [snip] -- Surveillance is pervasive.

A single instance of STUN\/ICE\/TURN is simpler to execute and manage than multiple instances STUN\/ICE\/TURN operations happening in parallel, as the latter require synchronization and create more complex failure situations that have to be cleaned up by additional code.\" I suspect this is all true, but I'd like to ask that section 4 also makes a similar summary claim at the end - saying that using a single 5 tuple and multiplexing multiple streams with *different* QoS expectation and therefore different DSCP markings can complicate the transport protocol design, by requiring a transport to disambiguate the congestion state for each network QoS category that is used. It will also result in increased complexity at the transport layer to validate path integrity, where a 5-tuple could result in a different routing\/forwarding path in order to validate that the individual 5-tuples are reachable. Of course, using DSCPs with an AF class can reduce some of the latter costs. etc according to what the draft says. I don't suggest that the extra complexity and additional algorithms are as big a problem as being unable to get through a NAPT\/Firewall, but it seems that this nonetheless extra stuff that I don't recall having been worked upon before in the IETF - and a challenge I guess for the RMCAT WG.

Gorry Hi Gorry, the following text will likely appear in the next version of my diffserv-intercon draft. The more DSCPs appear in a flow which aren't deployed end-to-end for the corresponding PHB, the more often one of the scenarios will be encountered. The following scenarios start from a domain sending IP traffic using a PHB and a corresponding DSCP to an interconnected domain. The receiving domain may - Support the PHB and offer the same corresponding DSCP - Not support the PHB and use the DSCP for a different PHB - Not support the PHB and not use the DSCP - Support the PHB with a differing DSCP, and the DSCP of the sending domain is not used for another PHB - Support the PHB with a differing DSCP, and the DSCP of the sending domain is used for another PHB Another question to be answered then is how a network provider will treat unrecognized or unexpected DSCPs received at network boundaries.

DiffServ and RTCP The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) [RFC3550] is used with RTP to monitor quality of service and convey information about RTP session participants. A sender of RTCP packets that also sends RTP packets (i.e., originates an RTP stream) should use the same DSCP marking for both types of packets. If an RTCP sender doesn't send any RTP packets, it should mark its RTCP packets with the DSCP that it would use if it did send RTP packets. If the RTCP sender uses or would use multiple DSCPs that differ only in drop precedence for RTP, then it should use the DSCP with the least likelihood of drop for RTCP to increase the likelihood of RTCP packet delivery. This guidance may result in different DSCP markings for RTP streams and RTCP receiver reports about those RTP streams. The resulting variation in network QoS treatment by traffic direction could result in unrepresentative round trip time (RTT) estimates that don't correspond to consistent network QoS treatment in both directions. RTCP receiver reports may be relatively infrequent (e.g., may be sent only once per video frame rendered) and hence the resulting RTT estimates are of limited utility for congestion control (although they have other important uses, see [RFC3550]). For this reason, it is not important that RTCP receiver reports receive the same network QoS treatment as the RTP stream or streams being reported on. RTCP multi-stream reporting optimizations for an RTP session [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-multi-stream-optimisation] assume that the RTP streams involved experience the same network behavior, including packet loss. This mechanism is highly inappropriate when the RTP streams involved use different DSCPs, even if the corresponding PHBs differ solely in drop precedence. 6.

The four bullet points in Section 2.1 that follow “The RTCWEB protocol suit encompasses a number of forms of multiplexing” seem to confuse RTP sessions, RTCP, and transport-layer flows. I suggest they be changed to: The RTP streams that comprise a WebRTC session can be multiplexed together in a number of ways: 1. Individual source streams are carried in one or more individual RTP streams. These RTP streams can be multiplexed onto a single transport-layer flow or sent as separate transport-layer flows. This memo only considers the case where the RTP streams are to be multiplexed onto a single transport-layer flow, forming a single RTP session; 2. The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) [RFC3550] may be multiplexed onto the same transport-layer flow as the RTP stream with which it is associated, as described in [RFC5761], or it may be sent on a separate transport-layer flow; 3. The RTP and RTCP traffic can be multiplexed with other protocols via UDP encapsulation over a common pair of UDP ports as described in [RFC5764] as updated by [I-D.petithuguenin-avtcore-rfc5764-mux-fixes]; and 4. The data may be further encapsulated via STUN [RFC5389] and TURN [RFC5766] for NAT (Network Address Translator) traversal. In the following paragraph (penultimate paragraph in Section 2.1), I suggest changing “unidirectional UDP packet flow” to “transport-layer flow” since it will not be unidirectional (since RTCP also flows in the reverse direction), and might not use UDP. In the first paragraph of section 2.2, I suggest changing “multiplexed over RTP sessions” to “multiplexed in a single RTP session” and “multiplexing of source streams in RTP sessions” to “multiplexing of source streams in a single RTP session”. In Section 6, the second bullet point refers to “an RTCP session”. There is no such thing. Rather, within a single RTP session there are RTCP packets sent that give information about the RTP streams that are being sent, and that report on the reception quality of RTP streams being received. Using a single PHB and DSCP for all RTCP packets within an RTP session might make sense, but it’s important to note that one role of RTCP is to provide an estimate of the round-trip time seen by the media, so the PHB\/DSCP will have to be chosen with care to avoid biasing that estimate too much. Editorial: the protocol is called WebRTC, but the working group is RTCWEB. Accordingly, I think all instances of “RTCWEB” in this draft need to change to “WebRTC”. Cheers, Colin Hi, The DART working group has started a last call for draft-ietf-dart-dscp-rtp-02, ending on August 22. This informational draft describes considerations for the use of DiffServ code points in situations where one multiplexes multiple RTP packet streams, and potentially other protocol streams, that share the same 5-tuple. Since this draft is likely of interest to several working groups, I would like to solicit additional reviews from participants of TSVWG, AVTCORE, MMUSIC, CLUE, RTCWEB, and RMCAT. Please send any feedback (including feedback to the effect of \"this is ready to progress\") to the DART working group mailing list. Thanks! Ben.

Title : Differentiated Services (DiffServ) and Real-time Communication Authors : David Black Paul Jones Filename : draft-ietf-dart-dscp-rtp-00.txt Pages : 23 Date : 2014-07-31 Abstract: This document describes the interaction between Differentiated Services (DiffServ) network quality of service (QoS) functionality and real-time network communication, including communication based on the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). DiffServ is based on network nodes applying different forwarding treatments to packets whose IP headers are marked with different DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs). As a result, use of different DSCPs within a single traffic stream may cause transport protocol interactions (e.g., reordering). In addition, DSCP markings may be changed or removed between the traffic source and destination.

The question is how the browser should behave when that happens. I spoke to Cullen about this, offline, after the DART session, and I believe he had a simple proposal. What would we expect DART to say about this? It seems to me that we should point out that we think different drop precedences for a single TCP connections doesn't make sense.

Yes, that matches my understanding, although the author team would like to see discussion of whether it's a good idea to mix RTP and non-RTP protocols on the same 5-tuple - I'll copy your useful diagram into a separate message to start that discussion. -------------------- This is that message, and I want to thank Ruediger for drawing that useful diagram. The author team for draft-york would like input on whether the draft should discuss mixing of RTP and non-RTP traffic on the same UDP 5-tuple, vs. using separate 5-tuples (probably separate UDP ports) for RTP and non-RTP traffic. One observation is that we should be thinking about a 6-tuple these days (see RFC 6437). I don't think it makes much difference to the argument. Another observation is when load balancing is in play, things get a bit more complicated, but to a first approximation using the same 5-tuple or 6-tuple will usually ensure that all the packets reach the same load-balanced destination, which is probably a good thing. Third, reverting to the diffserv discussion, the same 5-tuple should ensure that all the packets would be classified the same (if they cross a diffserv domain boundary and get reclassified). What do you mean by 'all the packets would be classified the same'? If you mean all the packets in a 5-tuple would get the same differentiated treatment, that is not desirable, because there are lots of folks wanting to send video i-frames or packets with FEC or other stuff with lower drop precedence than other packets. Dan, if a packet crosses a diffserv domain boundary, the assumption is that (absent a specific SLA) its DSCP *will* be rewritten in whatever way the classifier of the receiving domain desires. DSCPs don't have end to end semantics, unless there is a string of SLAs along the path that all provide the same DSCP semantics. Not everybody likes this, but it was what the operators in the diffserv WG wanted at the time. If all operators agree to implement a common subset of the DSCPs suggested in various TSVWG documents, there would be a de facto end to end SLA for those DSCPs. But today, that's a bit of a dream world. So, for two arbitrary RTCweb users, there's certainly no assurance that the DSCP set at the source will be preserved until the destination. On the contrary, it's quite likely to be set to zero (at the boundary of an operator that distrusts the DSCP field) or to a value deemed suitable by an ingress classifier for whatever 5-tuple it carries. It seems unlikely that a classifier will look further into the payload than the port numbers. Brian -d Brian RTCWEB clearly intends to mix SCTP (via DTLS) and RTP traffic on the same 5-tuple see the last paragraph of Section 3.5 of draft-ietf-rtcweb-transports-04: RTCWEB implementations MUST support multiplexing of DTLS and RTP over the same port pair, as described in the DTLS_SRTP specification [RFC5764], section 5.1.2. All application layer protocol payloads over this DTLS connection are SCTP packets. OTOH, concerns have been expressed about whether the not-exactly-elegant demux processing specified in the reference (RFC 5764, Section 5.1.2) ought to be recommended as a good way of doing this multiplexing.

Great - thanks for taking a look. If a MediaStream is carried in a RTP session, the text may also explicitely say that (it says MediaStreamTrack == media flow, which is carried in an individual RTP packet stream) As I read Section 11 of draft-ietf-rtcweb-rtp-usage-15, for RTCWEB, that would happen only when the MediaStream contains exactly one MediaStreamTrack. The use of these terms in bullet item 1 in section 2 is intended to be specific to RTCWEB, but we could add text elsewhere to point out that non-RTCWEB usage of MediaStreams could use an RTP packet stream for each Media Stream, independent of how many MediaStreamTracks each MediaStream contains. Could you suggest a reference that could be cited for usage of an RTP packet stream for each MediaStream independent of how many MediaStreamTracks each MediaStream contains? Careful - \"RTP packet stream\" is one of those concepts that can be meaningless without citing a specific definition. draft-ietf-avtext-rtp-grouping-taxonomy is probably the best reference at the moment. It says this about \"Packet stream\": 2.1.10. Packet Stream A stream of RTP packets containing media data, source or redundant. The Packet Stream is identified by an SSRC belonging to a particular RTP session. The RTP session is identified as discussed in Section 2.2.2. Under this definition, it's impossible to put more than one MediaStreamTrack into a packet stream. In a lot of cases (FEC, redundancy, SVC, simulcast), there will be multiple RTP packet streams associated with one MediaStreamTrack. The term is used only once in the draft, but unfortunately defines a new term to mean the same thing: The most common protocol used for real time media is the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP)[RFC3550]. RTP defines the mechanism by which real-time data is transmitted between hosts on the Internet. With most applications, a single media type (e.g., audio) is transmitted within a single RTP session. However, it is possible to transmit multiple, distinct media flows over the same RTP session as individual RTP packet streams. This is referred to as RTP multiplexing. For the purposes of this draft, the term \"media flow\" refers to a sequence of packets that is transmitted as a single RTP packet stream. The term \"media flow\" doesn't sound to me like a good term to use for this concept.

For example, the RAI area description says: The Real-Time Applications and Infrastructure (RAI) Area develops protocols and architectures for delay-sensitive interpersonal communications. Work in the RAI Area serves an industry whose applications and services include voice and video over IP, instant messaging, and presence. These applications and services are \"real-time\" in the sense described in RFC 3550. Real-time applications as in 3550 sometimes, but not always, need network guarantees as in 1633. (There's _lots_ of RTP running over best-effort networks.) It might be more precise to say that we are talking about (or at least charted to talk about) RFC 3550 applications that also qualify as real-time according 1633, but that the concepts may also apply to other applications that qualify as real-time as according to rfc1633. (I have a feeling we're putting too fine a point on this.) Fred Baker's OPS-Dir review of the dscp-rtp can be found here: http:\/\/www.ietf.org\/mail-archive\/web\/ops-dir\/current\/msg00504.html I want to thank Fred for his positive opinion of the draft and ask the WG whether any of the descriptive text from this paragraph of Fred's review (which was intended primarily as background info for the OPS Directorate members) ought to be picked up by the draft: As noted in its introduction, \"This memo covers the implications of these DiffServ aspects for real-time network communication, including WebRTC traffic [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-overview].\" The different \"diffServ aspects\" in question are the implications of running an application that aggressively marks its traffic for different network treatment in a best effort network - one in which traffic may be routinely reordered, duplicated, or lost in transit. If different DSCP marks result in different routing or the uses of different queues and therefore competing with different and potentially changing data flows ambient in the network, one would expect any such interactions to be exaggerated; for example, if multi-topology routing is used and some data flows take wildly different routes than others, one could readily imagine a packet in each data flow sent simultaneously arriving spaced tens or hundreds of milliseconds apart. While it is not referenced in the document, the term \"real-time\" as used here is defined in RFC 1633, and refers to an application that requires that the network make specific guarantees to it, whether in end to end delay, minimum delivery rate, or both. The term is generally understood to refer to voice and video services, but can also refer to telemetry or other traffic loads. My initial inclination is to pick up (in edited form) the text on the meaning of the term \"real-time\", including its reference to RFC 1633. Thoughts?

The author team for draft-york would like input on whether the draft should discuss mixing of RTP and non-RTP traffic on the same UDP 5-tuple, vs. using separate 5-tuples (probably separate UDP ports) for RTP and non-RTP traffic. One observation is that we should be thinking about a 6-tuple these days (see RFC 6437). I don't think it makes much difference to the argument. Another observation is when load balancing is in play, things get a bit more complicated, but to a first approximation using the same 5-tuple or 6-tuple will usually ensure that all the packets reach the same load-balanced destination, which is probably a good thing. Third, reverting to the diffserv discussion, the same 5-tuple should ensure that all the packets would be classified the same (if they cross a diffserv domain boundary and get reclassified). What do you mean by 'all the packets would be classified the same'? If you mean all the packets in a 5-tuple would get the same differentiated treatment, that is not desirable, because there are lots of folks wanting to send video i-frames or packets with FEC or other stuff with lower drop precedence than other packets. Dan, if a packet crosses a diffserv domain boundary, the assumption is that (absent a specific SLA) its DSCP *will* be rewritten in whatever way the classifier of the receiving domain desires. DSCPs don't have end to end semantics, unless there is a string of SLAs along the path that all provide the same DSCP semantics. Not everybody likes this, but it was what the operators in the diffserv WG wanted at the time. If all operators agree to implement a common subset of the DSCPs suggested in various TSVWG documents, there would be a de facto end to end SLA for those DSCPs. But today, that's a bit of a dream world. So, for two arbitrary RTCweb users, there's certainly no assurance that the DSCP set at the source will be preserved until the destination. On the contrary, it's quite likely to be set to zero (at the boundary of an operator that distrusts the DSCP field) or to a value deemed suitable by an ingress classifier for whatever 5-tuple it carries. It seems unlikely that a classifier will look further into the payload than the port numbers. So, by \"all packets will be classified the same\", you mean reset to zero. -d Brian -d Brian RTCWEB clearly intends to mix SCTP (via DTLS) and RTP traffic on the same 5-tuple see the last paragraph of Section 3.5 of draft-ietf-rtcweb-transports-04: RTCWEB implementations MUST support multiplexing of DTLS and RTP over the same port pair, as described in the DTLS_SRTP specification [RFC5764], section 5.1.2. All application layer protocol payloads over this DTLS connection are SCTP packets. OTOH, concerns have been expressed about whether the not-exactly-elegant demux processing specified in the reference (RFC 5764, Section 5.1.2) ought to be recommended as a good way of doing this multiplexing. Please comment, including whether mixing SCTP and RTP on the same UDP 5-tuple is a good idea (some rationale for doing this sort of multiplexing onto a single 5-tuple can be found in Section 3 of draft-york-dart-dscp-rtp-00).

Title : Differentiated Services (DiffServ) and Real-time Communication Authors : David Black Paul Jones Filename : draft-ietf-dart-dscp-rtp-08.txt Pages : 26 Date : 2014-10-16 Abstract: This memo describes the interaction between Differentiated Services (DiffServ) network quality of service (QoS) functionality and real- time network communication, including communication based on the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). DiffServ is based on network nodes applying different forwarding treatments to packets whose IP headers are marked with different DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs). WebRTC applications, as well as some conferencing applications, have begun using the Session Description Protocol (SDP) bundle negotiation mechanism to send multiple traffic streams with different QoS requirements using the same network 5-tuple. The results of using multiple DSCPs to obtain different QoS treatments within a single network 5-tuple (e.g., reordering) have transport protocol interactions, particularly with congestion control functionality. In addition, DSCP markings may be changed or removed between the traffic source and destination. This memo covers the implications of these DiffServ aspects for real-time network communication, including WebRTC.

This makes sense from an economical point of view, but limits deployments to the minimum common denominator. - to configure a PHB, there are classifiers, policers, schedulers, AQM and re-markers. Implementations differ to some aspects (e.g. on supported number of classes and ingress\/egress remarking). Limits like less than 20 PHBs may apply today. I'd be interested, whether there are offers of any complete AF class as part of a single product. - there used to be a possibility to ignore the lower DSCP bits 3-6, but there's no standard to that.

Keep in mind the possible restrictions on the number of PHBs. - many IP\/MPLS backbone networks and also many Ethernet based access networks support 3-4 PHBs for retail services. I'm not aware of any two providers using exactly the same DSCPs. I'm also not aware of any two standards using fully matching DSCPs for their PHBs (IETF, GSMA, MEF). - There's something I'd call enterprise philosophy, that is making use of a large set of internal PHBs. I never saw any of these philosophies remotely resembling the other. PHBs or classes are used to identify products, access types, stream types and so on. These usually just consume PHBs with sometimes at best loose relation to standards. If end-to-end DiffServ PHBs are what you look for, standardise what is really required and be clear on how to use it. If a network provider is expected to support these PHBs, there must be a convincing reason to do so. Take EF as an example for a well specified DiffServ standard.

This note is an attempt to pick up non-editorial items that haven't been dealt with in other messages on the list. I see four of them: RG: [snip] [4] 2.4 DSCP remarking The discussion of token-bucket-based remarkers leaves me a bit confused. To me, it's obvious (?) that token-bucket-based remarkers would operate in color-blind mode on a network boundary, and in color-sensitive mode only when they had assurance that incoming markings were already indicating color. Thus, flows from an end-user system should only hit color-blind remarkers; the real question is: will a color-blind remarker use the incoming DSCP codepoint to decide which of a group of remarking treatments it chooses for the packets? I'm not sure about the \"obvious\" point - anyone care to comment on what's actually deployed\/configured in practice? The answer to the final question about choice of remarking treatment is \"yes\" although the PHBs in an AF class should receive the same treatment. The fact that the question was asked suggests that the discussion of traffic classifiers needs some additional clarity and explanation. Thanks, --David"}

This draft is a work item of the DiffServ Applied to Real-time Transports Working Group of the IETF. Title : Differentiated Services (DiffServ) and Real-time Communication Authors : David Black Paul Jones Filename : draft-ietf-dart-dscp-rtp-03.txt Pages : 25 Date : 2014-08-22 Abstract: This document describes the interaction between Differentiated Services (DiffServ) network quality of service (QoS) functionality and real-time network communication, including communication based on the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). DiffServ is based on network nodes applying different forwarding treatments to packets whose IP headers are marked with different DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs). As a result, use of different DSCPs within a single traffic stream may cause transport protocol interactions (e.g., reordering). In addition, DSCP markings may be changed or removed between the traffic source and destination. This document covers the implications of these DiffServ aspects for real-time network communication, including WebRTC.

Flows managed by this algorithm and flows competing against at a bottleneck may have different DSCP[RFC5865] markings depending on the type of traffic, or may be subject to flow-based QoS. A particular bottleneck or section of the network path may or may not honor DSCP markings. The algorithm should attempt to leverage DSCP markings when they're available. I think the DART dscp-rtp draft text is ok wrt that RMCAT draft text, as the RMCAT draft uses the unmodified word \"flow\" and hence is silent on presence, absence, and\/or scope of multiplexing. It's also the case that the DART draft is supposed to document the present state of things, whereas this RMCAT requirements draft concerns future congestion control mechanisms. OTOH, the text in the DART draft on coupled congestion controllers appears to be somewhat off, as the guideline on avoidance of reordering within the scope of a common (coupled) congestion controller only applies when all bottlenecks are assumed to be shared, as opposed to when measurements are used to detect them. That makes the second half of the first guideline bullet in Section 6 too broad, and may suggest some additional edits to the text on shared bottleneck detection in Section 5.1. Here are the text changes that should correct this situation: -- Section 5.1 OLD Shared bottlenecks can be detected via correlations of measured metrics such as one-way delay. An alternative approach assumes that the set of packets on a single 5-tuple marked with DSCPs that do not allow reordering will utilize a common network path and common forwarding resources at each network node. NEW Shared bottlenecks can be detected via techniques such as correlation of one-way delay measurements across RTP streams. An alternate approach is to assume that the set of packets on a single 5-tuple marked with DSCPs that do not allow reordering will utilize a common network path and common forwarding resources at each network node. -- Section 6 After: o Should not use different PHBs and DSCPs that allow reordering within a single RTP stream. If this is not done, significant network reordering may overwhelm implementation assumptions about reordering limits, e.g., jitter buffer size, causing poor user experiences, see Section 5.2 above. OLD When a common (coupled) congestion controller is used across multiple RTP streams, this recommendation against use of PHBs and DSCPs that allow reordering applies across all of the RTP streams that are within the scope of a single common (coupled) congestion controller. NEW This guideline applies to all of the RTP streams that are within the scope of a common (coupled) congestion controller that does not use per-RTP-stream measurements for bottleneck detection.

Since RTCP is somewhat important, it would make sense for each SSRC to mark the RTCP packets it sends using the highest priority code point it uses to mark the RTP media packets it sends. That makes sense to me. Paul, and others, do you agree with that last paragraph? <editor hat off> Sure, when there's a notion of priority or importance. There won't always be one (e.g., is CS2 higher priority than AF2x? That depends ...). OTOH, we don't need to say much here, e.g., the class selector codepoints (CSx) are ordered, and adding a pointer to draft-ietf-tsvwg-rtcweb-qos will be helpful. <\/editor hat off> Turning to the other RTCP issue, [F] on multi-stream optimization, I wonder whether we inadvertently framed that issue backwards. Given the above, a single RTCP report on multiple RTP streams that use rather different DSCPs may not result in representative RTT values for all of the streams, because the report has to be sent with one DSCP. If that outcome is a problem, one should send separate RTCP reports (duh!). Each reporting SSRC sends a separate RTCP report block for each SSRC it receives, so this is not a problem. The question is what marking an SSRC uses for the RTCP packets it sends, given that it uses several different markings for the RTP media packets it sends. That statement seems valuable to make and can be made with a citation of RFC 3530, as opposed to the multi-stream optimization draft. Harald and Colin - what do you think?

Apart from the issues with remapping, the use of flow labels should have many of the same aspects as the use of DSCP codepoints. Can you give us some idea of how the use (or not) of multiple flow labels within a 5-tuple has been thought about in the IPv6 context? It hasn't, because the model is that the label will be the same for all packets in a given flow, and a flow is usually assumed to be identified by its 5-tuple. But there are words at the very beginning of RFC 6437 that intentionally leave room for breaking that assumption: 1. Introduction From the viewpoint of the network layer, a flow is a sequence of packets sent from a particular source to a particular unicast, anycast, or multicast destination that a node desires to label as a flow. From an upper-layer viewpoint, a flow could consist of all packets in one direction of a specific transport connection or media stream. However, a flow is not necessarily 1:1 mapped to a transport connection. So the door is open for multiple labels for the same 5-tuple, but always remembering that the label might be used as part of a load-balancing mechanism (as discussed in RFC 6438 and RFC 7098). Also, here's the bad news, remapping cannot be completely excluded for the flow label. See http:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc6437#section-6 and in particular http:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc6437#section-6.1 Brian Harald On 06\/11\/2014 10:42 PM, Brian E Carpenter wrote: In another message, Ruediger Geib asked (>), and I responded: -------------------- Is the following correct: UDP_5-tuple-+--transport protocol 1----- | +--RTP session 1----- | +--RTP session 2-----+---RTP_stream_2.1 | +---RTP_stream_2.2 |... Yes, that matches my understanding, although the author team would like to see discussion of whether it's a good idea to mix RTP and non-RTP protocols on the same 5-tuple - I'll copy your useful diagram into a separate message to start that discussion. -------------------- This is that message, and I want to thank Ruediger for drawing that useful diagram. The author team for draft-york would like input on whether the draft should discuss mixing of RTP and non-RTP traffic on the same UDP 5-tuple, vs. using separate 5-tuples (probably separate UDP ports) for RTP and non-RTP traffic. One observation is that we should be thinking about a 6-tuple these days (see RFC 6437). I don't think it makes much difference to the argument. Another observation is when load balancing is in play, things get a bit more complicated, but to a first approximation using the same 5-tuple or 6-tuple will usually ensure that all the packets reach the same load-balanced destination, which is probably a good thing. Third, reverting to the diffserv discussion, the same 5-tuple should ensure that all the packets would be classified the same (if they cross a diffserv domain boundary and get reclassified). Brian RTCWEB clearly intends to mix SCTP (via DTLS) and RTP traffic on the same 5-tuple see the last paragraph of Section 3.5 of draft-ietf-rtcweb-transports-04: RTCWEB implementations MUST support multiplexing of DTLS and RTP over the same port pair, as described in the DTLS_SRTP specification [RFC5764], section 5.1.2. All application layer protocol payloads over this DTLS connection are SCTP packets. OTOH, concerns have been expressed about whether the not-exactly-elegant demux processing specified in the reference (RFC 5764, Section 5.1.2) ought to be recommended as a good way of doing this multiplexing. Please comment, including whether mixing SCTP and RTP on the same UDP 5-tuple is a good idea (some rationale for doing this sort of multiplexing onto a single 5-tuple can be found in Section 3 of draft-york-dart-dscp-rtp-00).

The four bullet points in Section 2.1 that follow “The RTCWEB protocol suit encompasses a number of forms of multiplexing” seem to confuse RTP sessions, RTCP, and transport-layer flows. I suggest they be changed to: The RTP streams that comprise a WebRTC session can be multiplexed together in a number of ways: 1. Individual source streams are carried in one or more individual RTP streams. These RTP streams can be multiplexed onto a single transport-layer flow or sent as separate transport-layer flows. This memo only considers the case where the RTP streams are to be multiplexed onto a single transport-layer flow, forming a single RTP session; 2. The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) [RFC3550] may be multiplexed onto the same transport-layer flow as the RTP stream with which it is associated, as described in [RFC5761], or it may be sent on a separate transport-layer flow; 3. The RTP and RTCP traffic can be multiplexed with other protocols via UDP encapsulation over a common pair of UDP ports as described in [RFC5764] as updated by [I-D.petithuguenin-avtcore-rfc5764-mux-fixes]; and Can we clarify what \"other protocols\" are expected? Are we just talking about WebRTC data-channels over SCTP\/DTLS, or other things? If the latter, are we talking things we expect to do today, or in immediate futures, or extensions that might happen someday? 4. The data may be further encapsulated via STUN [RFC5389] and TURN [RFC5766] for NAT (Network Address Translator) traversal. In the following paragraph (penultimate paragraph in Section 2.1), I suggest changing “unidirectional UDP packet flow” to “transport-layer flow” since it will not be unidirectional (since RTCP also flows in the reverse direction), and might not use UDP. In the first paragraph of section 2.2, I suggest changing “multiplexed over RTP sessions” to “multiplexed in a single RTP session” and “multiplexing of source streams in RTP sessions” to “multiplexing of source streams in a single RTP session”. In Section 6, the second bullet point refers to “an RTCP session”. There is no such thing. Rather, within a single RTP session there are RTCP packets sent that give information about the RTP streams that are being sent, and that report on the reception quality of RTP streams being received. Using a single PHB and DSCP for all RTCP packets within an RTP session might make sense, but it’s important to note that one role of RTCP is to provide an estimate of the round-trip time seen by the media, so the PHB\/DSCP will have to be chosen with care to avoid biasing that estimate too much. Editorial: the protocol is called WebRTC, but the working group is RTCWEB. Accordingly, I think all instances of “RTCWEB” in this draft need to change to “WebRTC”.

Some vendors removed this option and with IPv6, each PHB must be classified and completely configured individually by DSCP. That's a good thing, since that behavior (per DSCP traffic handling) is a core element of the DiffServ architecture, and is required by RFC 2474 (Section 3). Please be aware, if it comes to a re-write, a single DSCP is set for all incoming DSCPs matching this PHB. Keep in mind the possible restrictions on the number of PHBs. Full AF support should classify all 3 PHBs that make up an AF class into a single aggregate on the node, with remarking applied to that aggregate, not DSCP by DSCP. If end-to-end DiffServ PHBs are what you look for, standardize what is really required and be clear on how to use it. As noted earlier, that's not the goal of the dart WG, as I understand it.

This makes sense from an economical point of view, but limits deployments to the minimum common denominator. - to configure a PHB, there are classifiers, policers, schedulers, AQM and re-markers. Implementations differ to some aspects (e.g. on supported number of classes and ingress\/egress remarking). Limits like less than 20 PHBs may apply today. I'd be interested, whether there are offers of any complete AF class as part of a single product. - there used to be a possibility to ignore the lower DSCP bits 3-6, but there's no standard to that.

Please be aware, if it comes to a re-write, a single DSCP is set for all incoming DSCPs matching this PHB. Keep in mind the possible restrictions on the number of PHBs. - many IP\/MPLS backbone networks and also many Ethernet based access networks support 3-4 PHBs for retail services. I'm not aware of any two providers using exactly the same DSCPs. I'm also not aware of any two standards using fully matching DSCPs for their PHBs (IETF, GSMA, MEF). - There's something I'd call enterprise philosophy, that is making use of a large set of internal PHBs. I never saw any of these philosophies remotely resembling the other. PHBs or classes are used to identify products, access types, stream types and so on. These usually just consume PHBs with sometimes at best loose relation to standards. If end-to-end DiffServ PHBs are what you look for, standardise what is really required and be clear on how to use it. If a network provider is expected to support these PHBs, there must be a convincing reason to do so. Take EF as an example for a well specified DiffServ standard.

To me, it's obvious (?) that token-bucket-based remarkers would operate in color-blind mode on a network boundary, and in color-sensitive mode only when they had assurance that incoming markings were already indicating color. Thus, flows from an end-user system should only hit color-blind remarkers; the real question is: will a color-blind remarker use the incoming DSCP codepoint to decide which of a group of remarking treatments it chooses for the packets? I'm not sure about the \"obvious\" point - anyone care to comment on what's actually deployed\/configured in practice? The answer to the final question about choice of remarking treatment is \"yes\" although the PHBs in an AF class should receive the same treatment.

On a personal note I tend to think that having 17+ ways to slice up traffic is about 13 or 14 too many, particularly those targetting a drop probability. When you have drop rates well below a few percentage points, adding another percentage point of granularity seems futile.

The draft's been reorganized since the version that Gorry reviewed, so the guidelines that were in Section 4 are now in Section 6. This does feel like a good discussion to add, as it strengthens the rationale for a single PHB\/DSCP for a single TCP connection, SCTP association or DCCP connection. This discussion feels like it belongs in Section 5 somewhere, and I would say the same for some of the rationale for that single PHB\/DSCP guideline, as it's not as clear as it could be about reordering (always a bad idea) and different drop precedences (complexity, lack of operational experience), and hence could use some elaboration. I'd suggest a new Section 5.4 on \"single PHB\/DSCP for a single TCP connection, SCTP association or DCCP connection\" to expand that rationale and pick up discussion of Gorry's item (1), as it applies (in different ways) to both reordering and different drop precedences.

(2) I don't know if the document's goal is also to make transport recommendations for using multiple code points - i.e.things such as must be robust to the network changing a DSCP; needs to independently verify that a particular DCSP is not being black-holed, needs to not imply relative precedence when interpreting loss or marking of packets for a flow using multiple DCSPs etc. ???

DiffServ and RTCP The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) [RFC3550] is used with RTP to monitor quality of service and convey information about RTP session participants. A sender of RTCP packets that also sends RTP packets (i.e., originates an RTP stream) should use the same DSCP marking for both types of packets. If an RTCP sender doesn't send any RTP packets, it should mark its RTCP packets with the DSCP that it would use if it did send RTP packets. If the RTCP sender uses or would use multiple DSCPs that differ only in drop precedence for RTP, then it should use the DSCP with the least likelihood of drop for RTCP to increase the likelihood of RTCP packet delivery. This guidance may result in different DSCP markings for RTP streams and RTCP receiver reports about those RTP streams. The resulting variation in network QoS treatment by traffic direction could result in unrepresentative round trip time (RTT) estimates that don't correspond to consistent network QoS treatment in both directions. RTCP receiver reports may be relatively infrequent (e.g., may be sent only once per video frame rendered) and hence the resulting RTT estimates are of limited utility for congestion control (although they have other important uses, see [RFC3550]). For this reason, it is not important that RTCP receiver reports receive the same network QoS treatment as the RTP stream or streams being reported on. RTCP multi-stream reporting optimizations for an RTP session [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-multi-stream-optimisation] assume that the RTP streams involved experience the same network behavior, including packet loss. This mechanism is highly inappropriate when the RTP streams involved use different DSCPs, even if the corresponding PHBs differ solely in drop precedence. 6. Guidelines [... snip ...] o Should use a single DSCP for RTCP packets, which should be a DSCP used for RTP packets that are or would be sent by the same sender, see Section 5.4.

It's just to give guidance on DSCP choices for multiplexed media. So I think the question becomes, has RMCAT made decisions (or looks very likely to make decisions) to use RTCP in a way that would be impacted by our DSCP recommendations? I’m not aware of whether such a decision has been made. I don’t believe RMCAT has considered this issue. Ben, Colin, On (2) below, it might be a challenge to get agreement quickly, but it might be nice if we could. As this work relates to RMCAT, determining one-way delay or changes thereto will likely prove important. In general, I would expect perceived quality to be important and conveying quality metrics and\/or providing feedback to the sender so that perceived quality improves (in whatever form) will be important. I'm suspicious of use of any RTT calculation for any mechanism that might be used to improve QoE. If so, then we should document the potential impact. If _not_, then it seems to me the best we could do is mention that RTCP treatments may or may not have an impact on RTT estimates, and that the implementer should think about it. If accurate RTT measurements could be made, they could be useful. The problem is that in some environments, we know that RTTs will not be accurate. Sometimes they are, of course. We could have some text as you suggest, but I would personally prefer we not encourage use of RTT values for any particular purpose. :-) Getting feedback to the sender is important, though. In an ideal world, I would argue that RTCP packets should be marked with whatever DSCP value will deliver RTCP packets in the most expedient way. Since we don't have an ideal world, I don't know which DSCP value that would be. Would the starting positions of \"getting feedback is important, even of not for RTT estimates\" and \"we need RTCP for RTT estimates\" likely land on the same guidance for DSCP values? The argument to send RTCP packets in the most expedient way sounds reasonable. I don't know if we need to recommend a particular DSCP, since we already have quite a bit of text on how DSCPs might (or might not) map into some predictable PHB treatment. Good question and valid point. Nowhere in the document do we recommend the use of a particular DSCP value for any particular thing, and we should not recommend a particular value for RTCP in this document. I'm just not sure what statements should be made. I suspect we can all agree that RTCP information is important. It's just the DSCP-related guidance that goes with that that is challenging. I don’t agree that RTCP information should be sent as higher priority than the media. Ideally, it should be sent with the same priority as the media, so it can be used to sample the RTT. This RTT sample is independent of RMCAT. It’s in base RTP specification, and so is something we need to support to the extent possible. Since not all the media sent by a single SSRC has the same marking, my suggestion would be that each SSRC mark the RTCP packets it sends with one of the same code points as it uses to mark the media. Since RTCP is somewhat important, it would make sense for each SSRC to mark the RTCP packets it sends using the highest priority code point it uses to mark the RTP media packets it sends. -- Colin Perkins http:\/\/csperkins.org\/"}

I believe the key question is: Is the role of RTCP in providing RTCP estimates important enough to serve as the primary basis for providing guidance on DSCP usage w\/RTCP? Here's a summary of the \"yes it is\" viewpoint (from Colin Perkins): Using a single PHB and DSCP for all RTCP packets within an RTP session might make sense, but it's important to note that one role of RTCP is to provide an estimate of the round-trip time seen by the media, so the PHB\/DSCP will have to be chosen with care to avoid biasing that estimate too much. And a summary of the \"no it isn't\" viewpoint (from Paul Jones): it was proposed that RTCP should be marked the same as for RTP. The argument was that this is used for RTT calculations.

Using a single PHB and DSCP for all RTCP packets within an RTP session might make sense, but it's important to note that one role of RTCP is to provide an estimate of the round-trip time seen by the media, so the PHB\/DSCP will have to be chosen with care to avoid biasing that estimate too much. Paul (from shortly after the Toronto meeting: During the meeting, there was discussion of marking RTCP packets. Some notes I received on this topic suggested that it was proposed that RTCP should be marked the same as for RTP. The argument was that this is used for RTT calculations. If that is what was said, I'd like to state my disagreement. :-) The forward and reverse paths are not necessarily the same and there is nothing one should assume about the reverse path to provide guidance about the forward path (or vice versa). As perhaps a gross example, I have the ability to download far faster on my home Internet connection than I can upload. Other important traffic characteristics differ in each direction. Further, an RTCP packet might provide information related to several different RTP packets. I certainly would not want to see one RTCP packet per RTP packet. _______________________________________________ Dart mailing list Dart@ietf.org https:\/\/www.ietf.org\/mailman\/listinfo\/dart"}

This mechanism is highly inappropriate when the RTP streams involved use different PHBs, even if those PHBs differ solely in drop precedence. A quick follow-up to ensure this is clear: the multi-stream-optimisation cannot be used when reporting on received RTP streams where the different streams have different markings, since those streams are treated differently in the network. The marking I use for the RTP streams I send (and hence the marking I use for my RTCP packets) doesn’t influence whether I can use the multi-stream-optimisation, however. Colin That's based on this text from the last paragraph of Section 1 (Introduction) of the multi-stream optimization draft: This memo defines such an RTCP extension, RTCP Reporting Groups. This extension is used to indicate the SSRCs that originate from the same endpoint, and therefore have identical reception quality, hence allowing the endpoints to suppress unnecessary RTCP reception quality reports. When different DSCPs are used for SSRCs (RTP streams) that originate from the same source, the statement that they \"therefore have identical reception quality\" is clearly incorrect, so it looks like the current DART draft text is correct, IMHO.

Since RTCP is somewhat important, it would make sense for each SSRC to mark the RTCP packets it sends using the highest priority code point it uses to mark the RTP media packets it sends. That makes sense to me. Paul, and others, do you agree with that last paragraph? <editor hat off> Sure, when there's a notion of priority or importance. There won't always be one (e.g., is CS2 higher priority than AF2x? That depends ...). OTOH, we don't need to say much here, e.g., the class selector codepoints (CSx) are ordered, and adding a pointer to draft-ietf-tsvwg-rtcweb-qos will be helpful. <\/editor hat off> Turning to the other RTCP issue, [F] on multi-stream optimization, I wonder whether we inadvertently framed that issue backwards. Given the above, a single RTCP report on multiple RTP streams that use rather different DSCPs may not result in representative RTT values for all of the streams, because the report has to be sent with one DSCP. If that outcome is a problem, one should send separate RTCP reports (duh!). Each reporting SSRC sends a separate RTCP report block for each SSRC it receives, so this is not a problem. The question is what marking an SSRC uses for the RTCP packets it sends, given that it uses several different markings for the RTP media packets it sends. That statement seems valuable to make and can be made with a citation of RFC 3530, as opposed to the multi-stream optimization draft. Harald and Colin - what do you think?

An authorization mechanism alone is probably not sufficient, because DS boundary nodes may need to police (e.g., remark\/drop) incoming traffic according to some agreed\/negotiated traffic profile for some of the PHBs, e.g., the EF PHB does not work properly if its traffic class is overloaded (see below). SD: Agreed. The previous line states: \" Therefore, the DSCP value may be remarked at the network edge through policy to any other DSCP value, including best effort.\". There is already a mention that apckers may be remarked or dropped and any additional mitigation is outside the scope of this draft. Sec. 4: The below uses the concept of a media flow, however these are commonly not equivalent to a transport flow, i.e. as defined by a 5-tuple (source address, destination address, source port, destination port, and protocol). I think one should try to use definitions that do not depend on the classifier type like 5-tuple, because as Brian already mentioned, for IPv6 a 3-tuple (IPsrc, IPdst, Flow Label) may be sufficient and header fields of the 5-tuple are not always accessible. I liked the definition of microflow in DiffServ as being an application-to-application flow of packets, usually being identified by that well known 5-tuple. For elements within the network microflows are usually the most fine grained distinction level for flows (except when you apply multi-field classifier that do some DPI and add the SSRC etc.). (nit: is probably a word like \"text\" missing in the first cited sentence above?) Proper definitions for media flow, RTP session, transport flow etc. may help to avoid confusion, so maybe one could try to combine efforts with draft-york-dart-dscp-rtp-00? SD:. There has been some discussion on the use of the word \"media flow\". Between the webrtc group and tsvwg, these words are defined or being defined. I will further check on it. Sec. 5: SHOULD use these values to mark the appropriate media packets. More information on EF can be found in [RFC3246]. More information on AF can be found in [RFC2597]. The problem with using EF is that if too many EF marked packets are injected into a DS domain, they probably void the EF properties for other users within this domain (background is that the service rate of EF packets on a given output interface must exceed their arrival rate at that interface over long and short time intervals - this is usually checked by admission control before use and policing at DS boundary nodes during use). Therefore, maybe some discussion w.r.t. RFC5865 http:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc5865 may be useful. SD: Agreed that admission control is very useful and relevant. This draft is intended for the selection and use of the right DSCP for webrtc media flows. There is a mention of over-subscription in the beginning. The above table assumes that packets marked with CS1 is treated as \"less than best effort\". However, the treatment of CS1 is implementation dependent. If an implementation treats CS1 as other than \"less than best effort\", then the priority of the packets may be changed from what is intended. BTW, there is no \"less than best effort\" PHB defined, but a Lower Effort Per-Domain Behavior (PDB) in RFC 3662 (http:\/\/tools.ietf.org \/html\/rfc3662). This RFC is also the source for the recommendation of using the CS-1 codepoint for that purpose, so you may considering referencing it. SD: Sounds good. Will do. If a packet enters a QoS domain that has no support for the above defined Data Types\/Application (service) classes, then the network node at the edge will remark the DSCP value based on policies. Yes, but even if there is support for these classes traffic conditioning (e.g., remarking\/dropping etc.) may be necessary and applied. Remarking to different PHBs may also lead to packet reordering within a media flow?! SD: Remarking\/dropping may occur, which is mentioned in the draft. Thanks again for the review of the draft.

Gorry Here's the next to last paragraph in Section 5.3: SCTP [RFC4960] differs from TCP in a number of ways, including the ability to deliver messages in an order that differs from the order in which they were sent and support for unreliable streams. However, SCTP performs congestion control and retransmission across the entire association, and not on a per-stream basis. Although there may be advantages to using multiple drop precedence across SCTP streams or within an SCTP stream that does not use reliable ordered delivery, there is no practical operational experience in doing so (e.g., the SCTP sockets API [RFC6458] does not support use of more than one DSCP for an SCTP association). As a consequence, the impacts on SCTP protocol and implementation behavior are unknown and difficult to predict. Hence a single PHB and DSCP should be used for all packets in an SCTP association, independent of the number or nature of streams in that association. Similar reasoning applies to a DCCP connection; a single PHB and DSCP should be used because the scope of congestion control is the connection and there is no operational experience with using more than one PHB or DSCP. I propose to add the following new sentence as its own paragraph: Guidance on transport protocol design and implementation to provide support for use of multiple PHBs and DSCPs in a transport connection (e.g., DCCP) or association (e.g., SCTP) is out of scope for this document.

Title : Differentiated Services (DiffServ) and Real-time Communication Authors : Dan York David Black Cullen Jennings Paul Jones Filename : draft-york-dart-dscp-rtp-02.txt Pages : 20 Date : 2014-07-04 Abstract: This document describes the interaction between Differentiated Services (DiffServ) network quality of service (QoS) functionality and real-time network communication, including communication based on the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). DiffServ is based on network nodes applying different forwarding treatments to packets whose IP headers are marked with different DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs). As a result, use of different DSCPs within a single traffic stream may cause transport protocol interactions (e.g., reordering). In addition, DSCP markings may be changed or removed between the traffic source and destination. This document covers the implications of these DiffServ aspects for real-time network communication, including RTCWEB.

Thanks! Ben. ---------------- **** Substantive: -- General: I was going to ask if we can be more precise on what sort of layering (and muxing?) we expect to really happen on top of DTLS, especially for WebRTC use cases. But I think Colin's comments are on the right track, so I will comment in that thread. -- Abstract (and intro) It's probably worth mentioning that, other than mixing RTP\/RTCP, RTP multiplexing is a relatively new thing. It's needed by new work such as WebRTC and clue, and it is enabled by bundle. The point being, this wasn't something we really needed to worry about until now. -- Section 2.1, list item 3: \"An RTP session could be multiplexed with other protocols ... \" What is likely to really happen here? I don't think we will see an arbitrary mixing of other protocols in the immediate future. What are the realistic constraints, and likely layerings? For example, with WebRTC, we are likely to see some number of RTP\/RTCP streams, stun, turn, and dtls, with dtls carrying one or more SCTP associations (i.e. data channels) right? Do we have ways to signal more than that in sdp-bundle? OTOH, I guess one could argue that people might try to mix in more things in the future. -- 2.1, 2nd to last paragraph, last sentence (starting with \"In contrast...\" Is this specific to SCTP associations carried over DTLS packets a la RFC5764, or are we talking about SCTP\/UDP in general? -- 2.2, third paragraph: Are we talking about TCP as the outer transport protocol, and muxing things on the TCP 5-tuple? Or are we considering TCP as something that might get multiplexed on the UDP 5-tuple? Where do Jonathan Lennox's comments about potentially falling back to an ICE TCP candidate fit? -- section 3, paragraph 5: Does the term \"network node\" include application endpoints that might do initial DiffServ marking? -- section 3, paragraph 12: \"... observable forwarding behavior (e.g., loss, delay, jitter) will often depend only on the relative loading of the link\" Relative to what? Other links? Relative load to the capacity of the link? -- section 4: It might be nice to have a more WebRTC-ish example. For example an audio stream, video stream, and a data channel carrying something like a shared white board or game. -- section 6, last bullet: Is there a such thing as \"less than best effort traffic\" where \"best effort\" treatments would be unacceptable? Actually, it's not clear to me from this paragraph if CS1 is ever appropriate, at least from the application endpoint perspective, as it seem to give completely unpredictable results. -- Normative References: Are these first two references both \"normative\" enough to block on them? **** Editorial: -- section 1, paragraph 1: \"As a result use of different DSCPs...\" Missing comma after \"result\". -- 3.2, paragraph 1: \"... and such nodes remark traffic ...\" May remark? Always remark? -- 3.2, paragraph 3, last sentence: Is this sentence redundant to the previous paragraph? -- 4, paragraph 1: 2nd and 3rd sentence These sentences seem to contradict. The first says that receiving audio early is not useful, but the second says it may be useful. -- 4, 2nd paragraph: \"... e.g., are in an AF class ...\" in the _same_ AF class? -- 5.1, 7th paragraph Is this paragraph redundant with previous discussions of AF classes? -- 5.2, third paragraph: Can you elaborate on what it means to be \"contained in a buffer\"? -- 5.2, around paragraph 5: There are words about why non-interactive media is likely to have larger jitter buffers, but the fact that interactive media may have smaller buffers us left to implication. -- 5.3, 1st and 2nd sentence: These seem redundant to previous discussions about AF classes. -- 5.3, 2nd paragraph: It's not clear to me what this paragraph means. Is drop likelihood the likelihood that anything is dropped in a session, or the chance of any given packet being dropped? I assume drop likelihood is relative to that of other sessions crossing the same path? And that under non congested conditions none of this will matter? -- 6, 1st paragraph: \" ... the following requirements ...\" Are these requirements per se, or guidelines? -- 6, bullet list Each bullet starts with a verb, but ommits the subject. E.g., in the first bullet, what is the actor that should not use different DSCPs within a different stream? -- 6, 1st bullet: The double negation is confusing (\"should not use\", \"If this is not done...\"). Also, 2nd bullet: Is \"use a single PHB and DSCP\" different than just saying \"use a single DSCP\"? 3rd bullet: Am I correct in assuming SCTP multihoming is not an issue here? Should we mention that explicitly?"}

In addition though, these PHBs can (and seem likely to be) policed to a conformant rate.

The four bullet points in Section 2.1 that follow \"The RTCWEB protocol suit encompasses a number of forms of multiplexing\" seem to confuse RTP sessions, RTCP, and transport-layer flows. I suggest they be changed to: The RTP streams that comprise a WebRTC session can be multiplexed together in a number of ways: 1. Individual source streams are carried in one or more individual RTP streams. These RTP streams can be multiplexed onto a single transport-layer flow or sent as separate transport-layer flows. This memo only considers the case where the RTP streams are to be multiplexed onto a single transport-layer flow, forming a single RTP session; 2. The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) [RFC3550] may be multiplexed onto the same transport-layer flow as the RTP stream with which it is associated, as described in [RFC5761], or it may be sent on a separate transport-layer flow; 3. The RTP and RTCP traffic can be multiplexed with other protocols via UDP encapsulation over a common pair of UDP ports as described in [RFC5764] as updated by [I-D.petithuguenin-avtcore-rfc5764-mux-fixes]; and Can we clarify what \"other protocols\" are expected? Are we just talking about WebRTC data-channels over SCTP\/DTLS, or other things? If the latter, are we talking things we expect to do today, or in immediate futures, or extensions that might happen someday? 4. The data may be further encapsulated via STUN [RFC5389] and TURN [RFC5766] for NAT (Network Address Translator) traversal. In the following paragraph (penultimate paragraph in Section 2.1), I suggest changing \"unidirectional UDP packet flow\" to \"transport-layer flow\" since it will not be unidirectional (since RTCP also flows in the reverse direction), and might not use UDP. In the first paragraph of section 2.2, I suggest changing \"multiplexed over RTP sessions\" to \"multiplexed in a single RTP session\" and \"multiplexing of source streams in RTP sessions\" to \"multiplexing of source streams in a single RTP session\". In Section 6, the second bullet point refers to \"an RTCP session\". There is no such thing. Rather, within a single RTP session there are RTCP packets sent that give information about the RTP streams that are being sent, and that report on the reception quality of RTP streams being received. Using a single PHB and DSCP for all RTCP packets within an RTP session might make sense, but it's important to note that one role of RTCP is to provide an estimate of the round-trip time seen by the media, so the PHB\/DSCP will have to be chosen with care to avoid biasing that estimate too much. Editorial: the protocol is called WebRTC, but the working group is RTCWEB. Accordingly, I think all instances of \"RTCWEB\" in this draft need to change to \"WebRTC\". Cheers, Colin Hi, The DART working group has started a last call for draft-ietf-dart-dscp- rtp-02, ending on August 22. This informational draft describes considerations for the use of DiffServ code points in situations where one multiplexes multiple RTP packet streams, and potentially other protocol streams, that share the same 5-tuple. Since this draft is likely of interest to several working groups, I would like to solicit additional reviews from participants of TSVWG, AVTCORE, MMUSIC, CLUE, RTCWEB, and RMCAT.

The text: This guidance may result in different DSCP markings for RTP streams and RTCP receiver reports about those RTP streams. The resulting variation in network QoS treatment by traffic direction could result in unrepresentative round trip time (RTT) estimates that don't correspond to consistent network QoS treatment in both directions. RTCP receiver reports may be relatively infrequent (e.g., may be sent only once per video frame rendered) and hence the resulting RTT estimates are of limited utility for congestion control (although they have other important uses, see [RFC3550]). For this reason, it is not important that RTCP receiver reports receive the same network QoS treatment as the RTP stream or streams being reported on. suggests that the RTT estimate derived from RTCP will be unrepresentative, since it may not have consistent network QoS in each direction. However, since the RTP media packets can use different QoS in each direction, the RTCP also needs to do so, to be representative! If the media used different QoS markings for different directions and the RTCP used the same marking, the RTT estimate wouldn’t match that of the media. I suggest the paragraph be changed to: This guidance may result in different DSCP markings for RTP streams and the RTCP packets reporting on those RTP streams. The resulting variation in network QoS treatment by traffic direction is necessary to get representative round trip time (RTT) estimates that correspond to the media path RTT. RTCP receiver reports may be relatively infrequent and hence the resulting RTT estimates are of limited utility for congestion control (although they have other important uses, see [RFC3550]). For this reason, it is important that RTCP receiver reports sent by an SSRC receive the same network QoS treatment as the RTP stream being sent by that SSRC.

Explicitly pinging Colin - Colin, are you arguing that the sentence RTCP multi-stream reporting optimizations for an RTP session [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-multi-stream-optimisation] assume that the RTP streams involved experience the same packet loss behavior. This mechanism is highly inappropriate when the RTP streams involved use different PHBs, even if those PHBs differ solely in drop precedence. should stay in the draft? I was, but thinking again, I'm not so sure. I think this recommendation is wrong. I can't find anything in your latest messages that speak to this particular point. You're one of the authors of -multi-stream, so you should be able to speak clearly to the point. Can you clarify? If I have several SSRCs, and receive several media streams, then provided each of my SSRCs sees the exact same quality for each received stream, then I can use the multi-stream-optimisation to reduce the number of RTCP cross reports I send. The multi-stream-optimisation draft says that already, and it's not clear that the DART drafts needs to say anything further on the topic. Whether I use the same DSCP for all RTCP reports I send is, I think, orthogonal to whether I use the multi-stream-optimisation. The dart draft should possibly say that, but I'm not sure that's the sentence we have above. I read the sentence above as saying flatly and unconditionally \"don't use multi-stream-optimization when the RTP streams have different PHBs\" - which means that if I want to use one PHB for audio and another PHB for video, I can't use multi-stream-optimization. I'd be sad if that was the case, *especially* if we can't figure out any reason to make that recommendation. _______________________________________________ Dart mailing list Dart@ietf.org https:\/\/www.ietf.org\/mailman\/listinfo\/dart -- Colin Perkins http:\/\/csperkins.org\/"}

In general I agree; but that only makes sense if there is an agreement (or mechanism) to define the nominal rate, and rate control of some kind at the source. (An IP phone is in effect a rate controller, for example.) A rate scheduler with single digit millisecond buffer depth and tail drop like behavior is not an issue. To me, that's a shaper configured to be EF compliant. If such a constraint is not desired then the text may say \"if mapped to a non-EF PHB, excess traffic may be shaped\". I'd like to ask for some explaining text if shaping of EF excess traffic is regarded as a property to be expected for this PHB. Yes, technically that's correct - but a shaper could be inserted at the boundary between two DS domains, and for the end-to-end user that will appear as a property of the PHB. If an AF class is used to transport EF, then any potential remarking should be done in a way avoiding re-ordering (i.e. remark to DSCPs within the same AF class only). There's no point in remarking excess EF traffic to a PHB which may cause reordering. I fully agree. I think that's what a text on remarking of EF should express, if remarking is kept as an option to be expected (I've not yet heard of such a deployment). Yes.

I've copied in some text of RFC3246 related to EF remarking and policing below. My take: . remarking of entire flows is an option, but no remarking of packets exceeding EF capacity limits. - looking at the EF jitter and delay properties, I doubt that shaping is desirable. RFC3246 doesn't mention shaping as part of EF conditioning. I personally wouldn't expect EF shaping in sections where policing is applied. - dropping of packets exceeding EF capacity is a MUST, if I interpret RFC3246 correctly. Well, it seems to me to be a SHOULD, with the MUST that you cite below being conditional on \"a mechanism that allows unlimited preemption of other traffic.\" So I would not be at all surprised by deployments that support shaping and remarking. Also, there are certainly implementations that are closer to RFC 2598 or RFC 3248 and therefore less strict. I think the draft should make it clear that there is likely to be variation in actual behaviour for EF traffic that exceeds the nominal rate. (Leaving aside the fact that without a string of matching SLAs along the path, the nominal rate might not even be well defined.) Brian I suggest to adapt the section of draft-dart-dscp to be more precise regarding the optional remarking of EF traffic and to remove shaping as a conditioning option if traffic is beyond the EF forwarding capacity limit.

Packets marked for EF PHBs SHOULD NOT be demoted or promoted to another PHB by a DS domain.

The problem is that the way the WebRTC APIs are structured, it’s not necessarily clear to an application that its media traffic is indeed going over TCP, so it might make precedence requests that the browser implementing the APIs can’t (and shouldn’t try to) satisfy. The question is how the browser should behave when that happens. I spoke to Cullen about this, offline, after the DART session, and I believe he had a simple proposal. Jonathan, Let's briefly discuss your point below: Different drop precedences are required if congestion within a PHB group may occur. TCP is designed for reliable transport. In case of a loss, TCP will reduce bandwidth and retransmit the dropped information. I'm not an RTP expert. The few applications known to me don't seem to benefit from such a behavior, if a single application flow uses different drop precedence levels in combination with TCP. It may make sense to have different TCP flows marked by different drop precedences. The less important TCP flows get throttled in the case of congestion. But is there a need to avoid re-ordering across different drop precedences, which is an AF PHB group feature? Again, I'm not an RTP expert - but that doesn't sound like making a lot of sense too. In general, I'd be interested to learn, if some applications were benefitting from ECN (or a congestion indication by marking rather than by dropping). Independent from the question whether they use TCP or RTP transport.

The former, quoting from Section 2.4 of the draft: In addition, remarking may remove application-level distinctions in forwarding behavior - e.g., if multiple PHBs within an AF class are used to distinguish different types of frames within a video flow, token-bucket-based remarkers operating in Color-Blind mode (see [RFC2697] and [RFC2698] for examples) may remark solely based on flow rate and burst behavior, removing the drop precedence distinctions specified by the source. So, from a DSCP perspective, there won't be a problem mixing traffic needing different DSCP in the same 5-tuple. Beyond that, if the network that the traffic is entering does not support the AF class involved on that ingress, DSCP remarking to zero (best effort) is a likely behavior. Sure. Only fix there is to restore the DSCP by some other sort of signaling. Which means separate 5-tuples (to make such signaling straight forward) or requiring network gear to peek deeper into the packets to restore the DSCP bits, such as distinguish STUN\/DTLS\/RTP packets from each other, and if RTP to use the solution-de-jour for how to identify more-important RTP packets from less-important RTP packets (such as RTP header extension which has been bantered about, or DPI).

If you mean all the packets in a 5-tuple would get the same differentiated treatment, that is not desirable, because there are lots of folks wanting to send video i-frames or packets with FEC or other stuff with lower drop precedence than other packets. That would most likely be within an AF class; the entire set of packets marked w\/different drop precedences within an AF class should be classified the same. Beyond that, one can hope that any AF remarker (e.g., for traffic shaping) is running in Color-Aware mode and hence tries to preserve source drop precedence distinctions, but this cannot be relied upon.

[Karen] Ok - \"certainly not viable\" is too strong formulation. Having different drop precedences within the same SCTP CC context would, given that SCTP CC presently is drop driven only, results in that the whole data channel is impacted, from a CC perspective, by the highest drop precedence. But I realize that whether this is acceptable is a question indeed. I think you're on to something here. If the drop precedences only came into play after the decision to drop a packet had been made, their effect would probably be minimal, as they would only affect what to drop in a session, not how much to drop. OTOH, DiffServ AF is not intended to operate in that fashion - the rationale for the 3 drop precedences per AF class was based on envisioning the output of two-threshold rate shaper: AFx1 - Within base or committed traffic profile AFx2 - Beyond base\/committed, but within excess or burst traffic profile AFx3 - Completely out of profile Hence the relative mix of those drop precedences can be expected to affect the overall drop rate\/probability seen in a session where those precedences are mixed. Yes. And it was clearly aimed at layered video, such that there was a benefit to the end user in dropping the least important layer during lossy periods. With anything like a TCP-like congestion control algorithm in sight, the effects may be completely bizarre. Reordering could make this even worse. Could different drop precedences cause reordering?

No apology necessary - you have the honor of submitting the first IETF Last Call comments on this draft. There's one change I'd like to suggest: Section 3.1, list number 2. briefly explains AF. The section doesn't explicitly mention that traffic carried by one of the three PHBs of an AF class are not reordered. This feature, avoiding reordering packets belonging to different PHBs of an AF class, is however a kind of punch line whenever AF is referred to in later sections. So I'd welcome mentioning it in section 3.1, list point 2. Sure, that's a good suggestion - I'll do that. That absence of reordering concept is covered elsewhere in the draft, but it first shows up in Section 5.1, so mentioning it earlier in Section 3.1 will help. On the minor comments, I'd just as soon not tinker with the example text in Section 4, our AD suggested emphasizing that point in Section 5.1 (but if other reviewers dislike \"very\", that word can be bit-bucketed), and the ECMP implementation described in your comments is one that cannot claim to support AF, as it does not meet the requirements of RFC 2597. It's a network operator responsibility to not run AF across such an implementation; I think that sort of DiffServ operational concern is best covered elsewhere. My current inclination is not to make any changes for these minor comments. And one editorial comment: Section 3., last bullet point and following section: the bullet point is focused on Lower Effort PHB marked by CS 1 and the following section continues by discussing CS 1 issues more general. This discussion may be added to the bullet point (to me the discussion doesn't seem to be related to the first bullet point). That's a good catch - the paragraph after that CS1 bullet point mixes two concepts that ought to be teased apart and merged into the two foregoing bullets to improve clarity: - Expanding on the non-requirements for different class selector code points to provide service differentiation. This text should be merged into the first bullet. - Expanding on the problems with assuming that CS1 selects a Lower Effort service. This text should be merged into the second (CS1) bullet.

The action of changing the existing protocols is implied rather than explicit in the current wording. \"current designs\" is vague. I suggest this as a starting point: \"Adding support for multiple QoS-based traffic classes within a single network 5-tuple to a transport protocol adds significant complexity compared to the current protocol definitions. For congestion-controlled transport protocols, network congestion information for each QoS-based traffic class would have to be disambiguated to allow congestion control to be managed separately for each such traffic class.\" Hopefully it can be made even simpler. Indeed, that sentence is problematic. I've edited the entire paragraph for clarity. Here's the new text: When PHBs that enable reordering are mixed within a single network 5-tuple, the effect is to mix QoS-based traffic classes within the scope of a single transport protocol connection or association. As these QoS-based traffic classes receive different network QoS treatments, they use different pools of network resources and hence may exhibit different levels of congestion. The result for congestion-controlled protocols is that a separate instance of congestion control functionality is needed per QoS-based traffic class. Current transport protocols support only a single instance of congestion control functionality for an entire connection or association; extending that support to multiple instances would add significant protocol complexity. Traffic in different QoS-based classes may use different paths through the network; this complicates path integrity checking in connection- or association-based protocols, as those paths may fail independently. In the first paragraph of 5.2, would \"Such reordering may lead to unneeded retransmission, and spurious emission of retransmission control signals (such as NACK) in reliable delivery protocols (see Section 5.1)\" work? Yes, and I've removed \"emission of\" from that proposed text.

On a second reading, I think that's mostly okay, but the consolidation of the RTP sections might make it more clear. -- Section 4, Bullets 3 and 4: Should STP in bullet 4 be SCTP?

I think I incorporated almost everything that was discussed in the meeting, but I've surely missed a few things - please comment (on list, or send me editorial changes directly). I want to call attention to this Editor's Note on draft organization: [Editor's Note: Current section structure skips around topics somewhat. The editor suggests restructuring to put real-time\/RTP material first (new section 2, consisting of current sections 2, 2.1 and 3), then DiffServ Background (new section 3, consisting of current sections 2.2, 2.3, 2.6 and 2.7, followed by discussion of interactions (new section 4, consisting of current sections 2.4, 2.5 and 5) and guidelines (current section 4, renumbered to new section 5).] If this change is made, I will submit a version that only contains the text rearrangement before making any other changes.

This draft is a work item of the DiffServ Applied to Real-time Transports Working Group of the IETF. Title : Differentiated Services (DiffServ) and Real-time Communication Authors : David Black Paul Jones Filename : draft-ietf-dart-dscp-rtp-00.txt Pages : 23 Date : 2014-07-31 Abstract: This document describes the interaction between Differentiated Services (DiffServ) network quality of service (QoS) functionality and real-time network communication, including communication based on the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). DiffServ is based on network nodes applying different forwarding treatments to packets whose IP headers are marked with different DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs). As a result, use of different DSCPs within a single traffic stream may cause transport protocol interactions (e.g., reordering). In addition, DSCP markings may be changed or removed between the traffic source and destination. This document covers the implications of these DiffServ aspects for real-time network communication, including RTCWEB. The IETF datatracker status page for this draft is: https:\/\/datatracker.ietf.org\/doc\/draft-ietf-dart-dscp-rtp\/ There's also a htmlized version available at: http:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/draft-ietf-dart-dscp-rtp-00 Please note that it may take a couple of minutes from the time of submission until the htmlized version and diff are available at tools.ietf.org.

I agree ... fortunately, the browser implementation of the APIs has to translate from the application priority to DSCP . As ICE is also running in that browser, that API implementation should know whether ICE did send all the traffic over TCP in which case, it has to pick once DSCP and use it for all traffic :-(. What would we expect DART to say about this? It seems to me that we should point out that we think different drop precedences for a single TCP connections doesn't make sense. But it is RTCWEB's issue to think things through if they have a use case that might make this happen, isn't it? The normative text for that single DSCP usage will wind up in the rtcweb-transports draft (just confirmed in the rtcweb meeting this afternoon), but it seems useful to repeat this in the DART draft and extend it to include TURN use of TCP, both client to TURN server and TURN server to peer. Maybe not for dart, but for turn: tunnel the drop precedence through turn so it can be applied on the other end???

VOLUNTEER NOW: we need to make 200. The DEADLINE is June 26 to volunteer. The IETF nomcom appoints folks to fill the open slots on the IAOC, the IAB, and the IESG (including IETF Chair). If your name is on the below, then you have volunteered and are qualified. In addition to those who volunteered by email, it also includes those who indicated their willingness to serve on the IETF90 registration form, and whose eligibility has been confirmed. 54 people were confirmed to be eligible, and 70 people were not confirmed based upon the email they have used to register. Those 124 people have been contacted directly. If you have heard from me, but are not on the list, then there is some problem, and you should have gotten a query from me to determine your eligibility. If you have volunteered and not heard from him, then please resend; it got lost. Ten voting members for the nomcom are selected in a verifiably random way from a pool of volunteers. The more volunteers, the better chance we have of choosing a random yet representative cross section of the IETF population. Let's break the 200 volunteer mark again this year! We are at 123 volunteers so far, and WE NEED TO HAVE 200!!! The details of the operation of the nomcom can be found in RFC 3777, and BCP10\/RFC3797 details the selection algorithm. Volunteers must have attended 3 of the past 5 IETF meetings. As specified in RFC 3777, that means three out of the five past meetings up to the time this email announcement goes out to start the solicitation of volunteers. The five meetings out of which you must have attended *three* are IETF 85(Atlanta), \\ 86(Orlando), \\ 87(Berlin), *** ANY THREE! 88(Vancouver), \/ 89(London) \/ If you qualify, please volunteer. However, much as we want this, before you decide to volunteer, please be sure you are willing to forgo appointment to any of the positions for which this nomcom is responsible. The list of people and posts whose terms end with the March 2015 IETF meeting, and thus the positions for which this nomcom is responsible, are IAOC: To be confirmed IAB: Joel Halpern Russ Housley Eliot Lear Xing Li Andrew Sullivan Dave Thaler IESG: Pete Resnick (Applications) Ted Lemon (Internet) Joel Jaeggli (Operations and Management) Richard Barnes (RAI) Adrian Farrel* (Routing) Stephen Farrell (Security) Spencer Dawkins (Transport) Jari Arkko (Gen) (names with * have publically indicated they will not serve another term) The primary activity for this nomcom will begin in July 2014 and should be completed in January 2015. The nomcom will have regularly scheduled conference calls to ensure progress. (We might dogfood WebRTC) There will be activities to collect requirements from the community, review candidate questionnaires, review feedback from community members about candidates, and talk to candidates. Thus, being a nomcom member does require some time commitment; but it is also a very rewarding experience. It is very important that you be able to attend IETF91 to conduct interviews. Being at IETF90 is useful for training. Being at IETF92 is not essential. Please volunteer by sending me an email before 11:59 pm EDT (UTC -4 hours) June 22, 2013, as follows: To: nomcom-chair-2014@ietf.org Subject: Nomcom 2014-15 Volunteer Please include the following 4 lines the email body (it is simplest if you just include the info); Your Full Name Emails used to register Telephone Current Primary Affiliation You should expect an email response from me within 3 business days stating whether or not you are qualified. If you don't receive this response, please re-send your email with the tag \"RESEND\"\" added to the subject line. If you are not yet sure if you would like to volunteer, please consider that nomcom members play a very important role in shaping the leadership of the IETF. Questions by email or voice are welcome. Volunteering for the nomcom is a great way to contribute to the IETF! You can find a detailed timeline on the nomcom web site at: https:\/\/datatracker.ietf.org\/nomcom\/2014\/ I will be publishing a more detailed target timetable, as well as details of the randomness seeds to be used for the RFC 3797 selection process, within the next couple weeks.

The receiving domain may - Support the PHB and offer the same corresponding DSCP - Not support the PHB and use the DSCP for a different PHB - Not support the PHB and not use the DSCP - Support the PHB with a differing DSCP, and the DSCP of the sending domain is not used for another PHB - Support the PHB with a differing DSCP, and the DSCP of the sending domain is used for another PHB Another question to be answered then is how a network provider will treat unrecognized or unexpected DSCPs received at network boundaries.

RFC2474 however proposes to transport the DSCP without remarking: Packets received with an unrecognized codepoint SHOULD be forwarded as if they were marked for the Default behavior (see Sec. 4), and their codepoints should not be changed. Such packets MUST NOT cause the network node to malfunction. The MUST NOT cause malfunction clause leaves a way out and I personally favor rewrite to default DSCP. There has been a discussion whether a rewrite of several incoming DSCP to a single outgoing DSCP is DiffServ compatible or not. Here we have such a rewrite. It seems to be alright for not supported DSCPs and PHBs. As you mention, a TCA\/SLA stating treatment of all DSCPs is important at network domain boundaries.

Quoting RFC 2475: \"A DS domain has a well-defined boundary consisting of DS boundary nodes which classify and possibly condition ingress traffic to ensure that packets which transit the domain are appropriately marked to select a PHB from one of the PHB groups supported within the domain.\" In other words the assumption is that (unless there's an SLA that allows the receiving domain to trust the incoming DSCP), a classifier is needed. My assumption has always been that the default classifier will simply re-mark packets with the default DSCP. We also have \"A DS ingress node is responsible for ensuring that the traffic entering the DS domain conforms to any TCA between it and the other domain to which the ingress node is connected.\" and the definition of a TCA: \" Traffic Conditioning an agreement specifying classifier rules Agreement (TCA) and any corresponding traffic profiles and metering, marking, discarding and\/or shaping rules which are to apply to the traffic streams selected by the classifier. A TCA encompasses all of the traffic conditioning rules explicitly specified within a SLA along with all of the rules implicit from the relevant service requirements and\/or from a DS domain's service provisioning policy.\" In other words: the treatment of unrecognized DSCPs needs to be stated in the TCA part of the SLA. Of course you could suggest a default approach in diffserv-intercon.

I deleted sections that do not need to seem further comment (or where the comment would have been \"okay\"). [...] -- Abstract (and intro) It's probably worth mentioning that, other than mixing RTP\/RTCP, RTP multiplexing is a relatively new thing. It's needed by new work such as WebRTC and clue, and it is enabled by bundle. The point being, this wasn't something we really needed to worry about until now. Could you suggest text for the Introduction section, along with any additional references? Okay, how about something like the following (perhaps inserted after \"... including communication based on the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)\") \"Historically, distinct RTP streams have been sent over different transport level flows, sometimes multiplexed with RTCP. But recently WebRTC applications, as well as some conferencing applications, have begun using the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] bundle negotiation mechanism [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation] to send multiple streams, potentially needing different QoS treatments, using the same IP 5-tuple.\" [...] -- section 4: It might be nice to have a more WebRTC-ish example. For example an audio stream, video stream, and a data channel carrying something like a shared white board or game. Sure, please send text. Okay, how about something like the following, added to the end of section 4: \"A WebRTC application may carry one or more RTP streams, as discussed above. In addition, it might carry an SCTP data channel. The treatment of the data channel would depend on the nature of the application. For example, messaging applications, shared white board, or guided browsing applications might be best effort, while a latency-sensitive game application might require a higher priority PHB. \" -- section 6, last bullet: Is there a such thing as \"less than best effort traffic\" where \"best effort\" treatments would be unacceptable? I can come up with possible examples - background bulk transfer of something large that should not interfere with foreground WebRTC data that is being carried as best-effort.

I want to hit one particular comment: [...] \"SCTP ... can be multiplexed with one or more RTP sessions\". Actually we can only multiplex SCTP with a single RTP session. There have been proposals that would allow multiplexing of multiple RTP sessions (each containing multiple media flows) over a single 5-tuple, but these were not accepted. [...] In bullet 2, only one RTP session can be multiplexed with another transport protocol (again). [...] Is this a matter of proper definitions of \"RTP Session\" vs \"Media Flow\"? (i.e. properly naming the thing that can be multiplexed?) Or is there a technical misunderstanding? Ben. The word \"session\" is one of the most horrible words in the vocabulary..... RTP packet streams that are in the same RTP session can be multiplexed over the same 5-tuple. RTP packet streams that are from different RTP sessions cannot. A media flow as you've defined it here (=\"packet stream\" from -taxonomy-) is identified by its SSRC. About \"RTP Session\", -taxonomy- has this definition: 2.2.2. RTP Session An RTP session is an association among a group of participants communicating with RTP. It is a group communications channel which can potentially carry a number of Packet Streams. Within an RTP session, every participant can find meta-data and control information (over RTCP) about all the Packet Streams in the RTP session. The bandwidth of the RTCP control channel is shared between all participants within an RTP Session. Alternate usages: o Within the context of SDP, a singe m=line can map to a single RTP Session or multiple m=lines can map to a single RTP Session. The latter is enabled via multiplexing schemes such as BUNDLE [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation], for example, which allows mapping of multiple m=lines to a single RTP Session. Characteristics: o Typically, an RTP Session can carry one ore more Packet Streams. o An RTP Session shares a single SSRC space as defined in RFC3550 [RFC3550]. That is, the End Points participating in an RTP Session can see an SSRC identifier transmitted by any of the other End Points. An End Point can receive an SSRC either as SSRC or as a Contributing source (CSRC) in RTP and RTCP packets, as defined by the endpoints' network interconnection topology. o An RTP Session uses at least two Media Transports (Section 2.1.13), one for sending and one for receiving. Commonly, the receiving one is the reverse direction of the same one as used for sending. An RTP Session may use many Media Transports and these define the session's network interconnection topology. A single Media Transport can normally not transport more than one RTP Session, unless a solution for multiplexing multiple RTP sessions over a single Media Transport is used. One example of such a scheme is Multiple RTP Sessions on a Single Lower-Layer Transport [I-D.westerlund-avtcore-transport-multiplexing]. o Multiple RTP Sessions can be related. About the possibility of putting multiple sessions on a single media transport, -taxonomy- says: 3.4. Multiple RTP Sessions over one Media Transport [I-D.westerlund-avtcore-transport-multiplexing] describes a mechanism that allow several RTP Sessions to be carried over a single underlying Media Transport. The main reasons for doing this are related to the impact of using one or more Media Transports. Thus using a common network path or potentially have different ones. There is reduced need for NAT\/FW traversal resources and no need for flow based QoS. However, Multiple RTP Sessions over one Media Transport makes it clear that a single Media Transport 5-tuple is not sufficient to express which RTP Session context a particular Packet Stream exists in. Complexities in the relationship between Media Transports and RTP Session already exist as one RTP Session contains multiple Media Transports, e.g. even a Peer-to-Peer RTP Session with RTP\/RTCP Multiplexing requires two Media Transports, one in each direction. The relationship between Media Transports and RTP Sessions as well as additional levels of identifiers need to be considered in both signaling design and when defining terminology. This is, in my opinion, a very longwinded way of saying \"this doesn't exist\". The -westerlund- draft expired this April. I have not heard of anyone pursuing it. _______________________________________________ Dart mailing list Dart@ietf.org https:\/\/www.ietf.org\/mailman\/listinfo\/dart"}

In an ideal world, I would argue that RTCP packets should be marked with whatever DSCP value will deliver RTCP packets in the most expedient way. Since we don't have an ideal world, I don't know which DSCP value that would be. Would the starting positions of \"getting feedback is important, even of not for RTT estimates\" and \"we need RTCP for RTT estimates\" likely land on the same guidance for DSCP values? The argument to send RTCP packets in the most expedient way sounds reasonable. I don't know if we need to recommend a particular DSCP, since we already have quite a bit of text on how DSCPs might (or might not) map into some predictable PHB treatment. Good question and valid point. Nowhere in the document do we recommend the use of a particular DSCP value for any particular thing, and we should not recommend a particular value for RTCP in this document. I'm just not sure what statements should be made. I suspect we can all agree that RTCP information is important. It's just the DSCP-related guidance that goes with that that is challenging. I don’t agree that RTCP information should be sent as higher priority than the media. Ideally, it should be sent with the same priority as the media, so it can be used to sample the RTT. This RTT sample is independent of RMCAT. It’s in base RTP specification, and so is something we need to support to the extent possible. Since not all the media sent by a single SSRC has the same marking, my suggestion would be that each SSRC mark the RTCP packets it sends with one of the same code points as it uses to mark the media. Since RTCP is somewhat important, it would make sense for each SSRC to mark the RTCP packets it sends using the highest priority code point it uses to mark the RTP media packets it sends. That makes sense to me. Paul, and others, do you agree with that last paragraph? I agree that the value should be one of the values used for media, but the challenge is specifying which DSCP value to use. If audio is sent using EF, video as AF41, app sharing video as AF31, etc., which of these does the endpoint choose to use for RTCP? Such an endpoint will have three SSRC values, and will mark the RTCP packets sent by each SSRC in the same way as the media packets sent by that SSRC. That is, the RTCP relating to the audio will be marked EF, the RTCP relating to the video will be marked AF41, and the RTCP relating to the application sharing video will be marked AF31. The RTCP packets for each stream are sent separately, so this case seems straight-forward. I'm a little confused here. These are separate SSRCs, but all part of a single RTP session. So, wouldn't the three SSRCs be reported in different report blocks in the sender report? The more difficult case is when an SSRC is sending video using different markings for RTP packets carrying the I- and P-frames. Should that SSRC then mark its RTCP packets like the RTP packets carrying I-frames, like the RTP packets carrying P-frames, or what? For this, I would argue it should be whatever DSCP that has the lower drop precedence (in the case of assured forwarding). Otherwise, it should be the same as the media, I'd think. Paul"}

Thanks! Ben. ---------------- **** Substantive: -- General: I was going to ask if we can be more precise on what sort of layering (and muxing?) we expect to really happen on top of DTLS, especially for WebRTC use cases. But I think Colin's comments are on the right track, so I will comment in that thread. Dealt with in other thread, on mux items 3 and 4 in Section 2.1. -- Abstract (and intro) It's probably worth mentioning that, other than mixing RTP\/RTCP, RTP multiplexing is a relatively new thing. It's needed by new work such as WebRTC and clue, and it is enabled by bundle. The point being, this wasn't something we really needed to worry about until now. Could you suggest text for the Introduction section, along with any additional references? -- Section 2.1, list item 3: \"An RTP session could be multiplexed with other protocols ... \" What is likely to really happen here? I don't think we will see an arbitrary mixing of other protocols in the immediate future. What are the realistic constraints, and likely layerings? For example, with WebRTC, we are likely to see some number of RTP\/RTCP streams, stun, turn, and dtls, with dtls carrying one or more SCTP associations (i.e. data channels) right? Do we have ways to signal more than that in sdp-bundle? OTOH, I guess one could argue that people might try to mix in more things in the future. Dealt with in other thread. -- 2.1, 2nd to last paragraph, last sentence (starting with \"In contrast...\" Is this specific to SCTP associations carried over DTLS packets a la RFC5764, or are we talking about SCTP\/UDP in general? It's SCTP\/UDP in general, clarified. -- 2.2, third paragraph: Are we talking about TCP as the outer transport protocol, and muxing things on the TCP 5-tuple? Or are we considering TCP as something that might get multiplexed on the UDP 5-tuple? Where do Jonathan Lennox's comments about potentially falling back to an ICE TCP candidate fit? It's TCP as the outer transport protocol, and this is part of the text that responds to Jonathan Lennox's comments (the rest of it is hidden in 5.3, and needs some more prominence, as it's missing from the guidelines). I added: When TURN selects use of TCP, the entire real-time communications session is carried over a single TCP 5-tuple. And added mention of this scenario (TURN selects TCP) to the guideline on TCP. -- section 3, paragraph 5: Does the term \"network node\" include application endpoints that might do initial DiffServ marking? No, changed to \"node in the network\". -- section 3, paragraph 12: \"... observable forwarding behavior (e.g., loss, delay, jitter) will often depend only on the relative loading of the link\" Relative to what? Other links? Relative load to the capacity of the link? Removed \"relative\" ;-). -- section 4: It might be nice to have a more WebRTC-ish example. For example an audio stream, video stream, and a data channel carrying something like a shared white board or game. Sure, please send text. -- section 6, last bullet: Is there a such thing as \"less than best effort traffic\" where \"best effort\" treatments would be unacceptable? I can come up with possible examples - background bulk transfer of something large that should not interfere with foreground WebRTC data that is being carried as best-effort. Actually, it's not clear to me from this paragraph if CS1 is ever appropriate, at least from the application endpoint perspective, as it seem to give completely unpredictable results. That was intended - would you like to see stronger language? -- Normative References: Are these first two references both \"normative\" enough to block on them? Well, the first one certainly is - if the relevant terminology in the rtp-grouping-taxonomy draft changes, this DART draft will change also, as has already been demonstrated. OTOH, I'll move both RFC 5764 and the rfc5764-mux-fixes draft to informative. **** Editorial: -- section 1, paragraph 1: \"As a result use of different DSCPs...\" Missing comma after \"result\". Fixed. -- 3.2, paragraph 1: \"... and such nodes remark traffic ...\" May remark? Always remark? It's \"may remark,\" but I rephrased for clarity - the sentence now reads: When DiffServ is used, the edge or boundary nodes of a network are responsible for ensuring that all traffic entering that network conforms to that network's policies for DSCP and PHB usage, and such nodes may change DSCP markings on traffic to achieve that result. -- 3.2, paragraph 3, last sentence: Is this sentence redundant to the previous paragraph? Not completely, but I moved the point about ignoring embedded headers into the previous paragraph and removed this sentence. -- 4, paragraph 1: 2nd and 3rd sentence These sentences seem to contradict. The first says that receiving audio early is not useful, but the second says it may be useful. Changed second sentence to talk about increased reliability of receiving audio ... because more reliable arrival of audio helps assure smooth audio rendering ... -- 4, 2nd paragraph: \"... e.g., are in an AF class ...\" in the _same_ AF class? Yes, changed to \"a single AF class\". -- 5.1, 7th paragraph Is this paragraph redundant with previous discussions of AF classes? I don't think the paragraph is redundant, but I removed \"as the three PHBs in an AF class differ solely in drop precedence.\" as that is redundant with 3.1. -- 5.2, third paragraph: Can you elaborate on what it means to be \"contained in a buffer\"? Added: \"because packets that arrive out of order are retrieved in order from the jitter buffer for rendering.\" -- 5.2, around paragraph 5: There are words about why non-interactive media is likely to have larger jitter buffers, but the fact that interactive media may have smaller buffers us left to implication. Elaborated first sentence in previous bullet - it now ends with \"such as interactive conversations for which small jitter buffers are necessary to preserve human perceptions of real-time interaction.\" -- 5.3, 1st and 2nd sentence: These seem redundant to previous discussions about AF classes. Tightened up - the point about same forwarding resources implying no latency variation needs to be made here. New text: Packets on the same 5-tuple that use PHBs within a single AF class can be expected to draw upon the same forwarding resources on network nodes (e.g., use the same router queue) and hence use of multiple drop precedences within an AF class is not expected to cause latency variation. -- 5.3, 2nd paragraph: It's not clear to me what this paragraph means. Is drop likelihood the likelihood that anything is dropped in a session, or the chance of any given packet being dropped? I assume drop likelihood is relative to that of other sessions crossing the same path? And that under non congested conditions none of this will matter? Deleted second sentence, and rephrased first to: When PHBs within a single AF class are mixed within a flow, the resulting overall likelihood that packets will be dropped from that flow is a mix of the drop likelihoods of the PHBs involved. I also joined it up w\/the previous paragraph. -- 6, 1st paragraph: \" ... the following requirements ...\" Are these requirements per se, or guidelines? Guidelines. -- 6, bullet list Each bullet starts with a verb, but ommits the subject. E.g., in the first bullet, what is the actor that should not use different DSCPs within a different stream? The subject was factored out - \"applications and other traffic sources\". I moved it to start a new paragraph. -- 6, 1st bullet: The double negation is confusing (\"should not use\", \"If this is not done...\"). Also, Now reads: \" Should limit use of DSCPs within a single RTP stream to those whose PHBs do not allow packet reordering.\" 2nd bullet: Is \"use a single PHB and DSCP\" different than just saying \"use a single DSCP\"? The latter is better for \"applications and other traffic sources\" Extensive editing resulted,. 3rd bullet: Am I correct in assuming SCTP multihoming is not an issue here? Should we mention that explicitly? It's not an issue, and does not really need to be mentioned here.

The four bullet points in Section 2.1 that follow \"The RTCWEB protocol suit encompasses a number of forms of multiplexing\" seem to confuse RTP sessions, RTCP, and transport-layer flows. I suggest they be changed to: The RTP streams that comprise a WebRTC session can be multiplexed together in a number of ways: 1. Individual source streams are carried in one or more individual RTP streams. These RTP streams can be multiplexed onto a single transport-layer flow or sent as separate transport-layer flows. This memo only considers the case where the RTP streams are to be multiplexed onto a single transport-layer flow, forming a single RTP session; 2. The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) [RFC3550] may be multiplexed onto the same transport-layer flow as the RTP stream with which it is associated, as described in [RFC5761], or it may be sent on a separate transport-layer flow; 3. The RTP and RTCP traffic can be multiplexed with other protocols via UDP encapsulation over a common pair of UDP ports as described in [RFC5764] as updated by [I-D.petithuguenin-avtcore-rfc5764-mux-fixes]; and Can we clarify what \"other protocols\" are expected? Are we just talking about WebRTC data-channels over SCTP\/DTLS, or other things? If the latter, are we talking things we expect to do today, or in immediate futures, or extensions that might happen someday? 4. The data may be further encapsulated via STUN [RFC5389] and TURN [RFC5766] for NAT (Network Address Translator) traversal. In the following paragraph (penultimate paragraph in Section 2.1), I suggest changing \"unidirectional UDP packet flow\" to \"transport-layer flow\" since it will not be unidirectional (since RTCP also flows in the reverse direction), and might not use UDP. In the first paragraph of section 2.2, I suggest changing \"multiplexed over RTP sessions\" to \"multiplexed in a single RTP session\" and \"multiplexing of source streams in RTP sessions\" to \"multiplexing of source streams in a single RTP session\". In Section 6, the second bullet point refers to \"an RTCP session\". There is no such thing. Rather, within a single RTP session there are RTCP packets sent that give information about the RTP streams that are being sent, and that report on the reception quality of RTP streams being received. Using a single PHB and DSCP for all RTCP packets within an RTP session might make sense, but it's important to note that one role of RTCP is to provide an estimate of the round-trip time seen by the media, so the PHB\/DSCP will have to be chosen with care to avoid biasing that estimate too much. Editorial: the protocol is called WebRTC, but the working group is RTCWEB. Accordingly, I think all instances of \"RTCWEB\" in this draft need to change to \"WebRTC\". Cheers, Colin Hi, The DART working group has started a last call for draft-ietf-dart-dscp- rtp-02, ending on August 22. This informational draft describes considerations for the use of DiffServ code points in situations where one multiplexes multiple RTP packet streams, and potentially other protocol streams, that share the same 5-tuple. Since this draft is likely of interest to several working groups, I would like to solicit additional reviews from participants of TSVWG, AVTCORE, MMUSIC, CLUE, RTCWEB, and RMCAT. Please send any feedback (including feedback to the effect of \"this is ready to progress\") to the DART working group mailing list. Thanks! Ben.

This note is an attempt to pick up non-editorial items that haven't been dealt with in other messages on the list. I see four of them: [1] 2.2 Diffserv PHBs do you want to mention what the difference between the 4 AF classes is? Is it just isolation, or is there a ranking between them (in theory or in practice)? Sure, there is a ranking between them. In general, higher numbered AF classes are expected to receive better forwarding behavior roughly akin to higher numbered class selector codepoints being expected to receive better forwarding behavior. [2] 2.3 Diffserv and transport protocols The last paragraph is true but irrelevant - we're not using UDP here, we're using other protocols carried inside UDP. And the stuff that's carried inside UDP may be sensitive to reordering or may be insensitive to reordering - we just can't tell purely from the fact that it's UDP. Suggest deleting the paragraph. I agree with the point, but rather than deleting the paragraph, I'd suggest expanding it to include discussion of the use of UDP to encapsulate protocols that are sensitive to reordering. One of the reasons for the existence of this paragraph is that it sets up the allowance for use of multiple PHBs that may cause reordering within a single UDP 5-tuple. [3] IMPORTANT: There is a huge missing section here - which is about sensitivity of real time communications to packet reordering. I agree, and thank you for the more detailed explanation that can be used as a starting point to write this section. [4] 2.4 DSCP remarking The discussion of token-bucket-based remarkers leaves me a bit confused. To me, it's obvious (?) that token-bucket-based remarkers would operate in color-blind mode on a network boundary, and in color-sensitive mode only when they had assurance that incoming markings were already indicating color. Thus, flows from an end-user system should only hit color-blind remarkers; the real question is: will a color-blind remarker use the incoming DSCP codepoint to decide which of a group of remarking treatments it chooses for the packets? I'm not sure about the \"obvious\" point - anyone care to comment on what's actually deployed\/configured in practice? The answer to the final question about choice of remarking treatment is \"yes\" although the PHBs in an AF class should receive the same treatment. The fact that the question was asked suggests that the discussion of traffic classifiers needs some additional clarity and explanation. Thanks, --David -----Original Message----- From: Dart [mailto:dart-bounces@ietf.org] On Behalf Of Harald Alvestrand Sent: Thursday, June 12, 2014 8:49 AM To: dart@ietf.org Subject: [Dart] Commentary on draft-york-00 This message contains running notes made during my initial review of draft-york-dart-dscp-rtp-00. Apologies for lack of organization; it seems better to get them out soon than to polish them. 2 Background \"any one or more modalities\" -> \"one or more modalities\" would read better. \"RTP defines the mechanism by which real-time data is transmitted\" seems like an overreach. \"RTP defines a common encapsulation format and handling rules for real-time data transmitted over the Internet\" would be more appropriate. \"With most applications, a single...\" - this is true for legacy. It seems likely not to remain true. The definition of \"media flow\" needs to be in a \"definitions\" section. It's too important to be hiding in the \"background\" section - see much other mail. \"SCTP ... can be multiplexed with one or more RTP sessions\". Actually we can only multiplex SCTP with a single RTP session. There have been proposals that would allow multiplexing of multiple RTP sessions (each containing multiple media flows) over a single 5-tuple, but these were not accepted. The mention of MediaStream should be removed from bullet 1. It just confuses. In bullet 2, only one RTP session can be multiplexed with another transport protocol (again). The last paragraph is where distinguishing between <some kind of media related name> and <RTP packet flow> is very desirable. As it stands now, it seems simple, but when you start asking what all these flows \"are\", more precisely, it gets very confusing. 2.1 DiffServ bullet 1, first list: grammar nit - \"classify traffic and setting bits\" -> \"classify traffic and set bits\" \"In this context, \"forwarding behavior\" is a general - for example\" .... is a general what, exactly? \"to allocates resources\" -> \"to allocate resources\" Nit: the all-zero DSCP seems to have only five zeroes. 2.2 Diffserv PHBs do you want to mention what the difference between the 4 AF classes is? Is it just isolation, or is there a ranking between them (in theory or in practice)? 2.3 Diffserv and transport protocols The last paragraph is true but irrelevant - we're not using UDP here, we're using other protocols carried inside UDP. And the stuff that's carried inside UDP may be sensitive to reordering or may be insensitive to reordering - we just can't tell purely from the fact that it's UDP. Suggest deleting the paragraph. IMPORTANT: There is a huge missing section here - which is about sensitivity of real time communications to packet reordering. I'm not sure how much can be said here, but I think this is quite complex: - Packet reordering may lead to spurious NACK generation and unneeded retransmission, just as for the data flow case. How sensitive it is to that depends on timers. - Packet reordering that can be accomodated within an existing jitter buffer will not lead to any quality issues. - Packet reordering that causes jitter buffers to extend is bad news for delay sensitive communication, such as interactive conversations. Interactive implementations may choose to discard late data - but this is a matter of meeting the deadline, not a matter of whether it's reordered. For replay of recorded media, it doesn't matter much. - Packet loss is dealt with differently on interactive media than on reliable data delivery: Instead of retransmissing all lost data, one finds a reference point that new data can be based on, and continues to transmit media relative to that. One does not attempt to recover lost frames that are history. How that affects this discussion ... I'm not too sure. 2.4 DSCP remarking The discussion of token-bucket-based remarkers leaves me a bit confused. To me, it's obvious (?) that token-bucket-based remarkers would operate in color-blind mode on a network boundary, and in color-sensitive mode only when they had assurance that incoming markings were already indicating color. Thus, flows from an end-user system should only hit color-blind remarkers; the real question is: will a color-blind remarker use the incoming DSCP codepoint to decide which of a group of remarking treatments it chooses for the packets? It seems to me that the section should tell me, and it doesn't. 3 RTP Multiplexing Background Repeating the story about \"only one RTP session per 5-tuple, please\".... 4 Recommendations As discussed above, the first SHOULD NOT (reordering within a media flow) is not sufficiently founded in discussion of media properties. Reordering may be a problem, or it may not be a problem. I don't see any issues with the other recommendations (the second seems like an obvious thing to say, for well documented reasons; the three others seem like no-ops from a practical standpoint).

Since RTCP is somewhat important, it would make sense for each SSRC to mark the RTCP packets it sends using the highest priority code point it uses to mark the RTP media packets it sends. That makes sense to me. Paul, and others, do you agree with that last paragraph? <editor hat off> Sure, when there's a notion of priority or importance. There won't always be one (e.g., is CS2 higher priority than AF2x? That depends ...). OTOH, we don't need to say much here, e.g., the class selector codepoints (CSx) are ordered, and adding a pointer to draft-ietf-tsvwg-rtcweb-qos will be helpful. <\/editor hat off> Turning to the other RTCP issue, [F] on multi-stream optimization, I wonder whether we inadvertently framed that issue backwards. Given the above, a single RTCP report on multiple RTP streams that use rather different DSCPs may not result in representative RTT values for all of the streams, because the report has to be sent with one DSCP. If that outcome is a problem, one should send separate RTCP reports (duh!). Each reporting SSRC sends a separate RTCP report block for each SSRC it receives, so this is not a problem. The question is what marking an SSRC uses for the RTCP packets it sends, given that it uses several different markings for the RTP media packets it sends. That statement seems valuable to make and can be made with a citation of RFC 3530, as opposed to the multi-stream optimization draft. Harald and Colin - what do you think? The discussion of the multi-stream-optimisation draft is a separate issue, and is correct as it is. -- Colin Perkins http:\/\/csperkins.org\/"}

You've asked for information on what's implemented today and that's what I've provided. Each AF DSCP identifies an individual PHB. If classification is DSCP based and limits apply on the number of PHBs, that's what providers have to respect. This limit still applies, if e.g. all AF4 packets are operated by the same scheduler (which I'd expect from a provider deployment). Each AF class (2 or 3 PHBs) usually only needs a single queue. It is not allowed to map an AF class to only a single PHB: Within each AF class, a DS node MUST accept all three drop precedence codepoints and they MUST yield at least two different levels of loss probability. So at least one needs to distinguish between AFx1 and AFx2\/AFx3. It is also somewhat demanding to configure 14 PHBs to support just rtcweb on a retail access and then provide additional PHBs for services of a provider. The provider may offer some services with admission control and If you want to realize all proposed mappings of http:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/draft-ietf-tsvwg-rtcweb-qos-00 you probably need 7 separate queues (LE, BE, AF1-AF4, EF) and at most 15 DSCP to PHB mappings. if rtcweb isn't running through the same admission control, this requires additional PHBs. Some carriers may have deployed DiffServ already, when rtcweb starts to use it. I think that you'll need admission control for EF and AFx1 PHBs otherwise you'll end up with best-effort behavior in overload situations... Regards, Roland"}

Gorry Here's the next to last paragraph in Section 5.3: SCTP [RFC4960] differs from TCP in a number of ways, including the ability to deliver messages in an order that differs from the order in which they were sent and support for unreliable streams. However, SCTP performs congestion control and retransmission across the entire association, and not on a per-stream basis. Although there may be advantages to using multiple drop precedence across SCTP streams or within an SCTP stream that does not use reliable ordered delivery, there is no practical operational experience in doing so (e.g., the SCTP sockets API [RFC6458] does not support use of more than one DSCP for an SCTP association). As a consequence, the impacts on SCTP protocol and implementation behavior are unknown and difficult to predict. Hence a single PHB and DSCP should be used for all packets in an SCTP association, independent of the number or nature of streams in that association. Similar reasoning applies to a DCCP connection; a single PHB and DSCP should be used because the scope of congestion control is the connection and there is no operational experience with using more than one PHB or DSCP. I propose to add the following new sentence as its own paragraph: Guidance on transport protocol design and implementation to provide support for use of multiple PHBs and DSCPs in a transport connection (e.g., DCCP) or association (e.g., SCTP) is out of scope for this document.

Gorry Hi Gorry, the following text will likely appear in the next version of my diffserv-intercon draft. The more DSCPs appear in a flow which aren't deployed end-to-end for the corresponding PHB, the more often one of the scenarios will be encountered. The following scenarios start from a domain sending IP traffic using a PHB and a corresponding DSCP to an interconnected domain. The receiving domain may - Support the PHB and offer the same corresponding DSCP - Not support the PHB and use the DSCP for a different PHB - Not support the PHB and not use the DSCP - Support the PHB with a differing DSCP, and the DSCP of the sending domain is not used for another PHB - Support the PHB with a differing DSCP, and the DSCP of the sending domain is used for another PHB Another question to be answered then is how a network provider will treat unrecognized or unexpected DSCPs received at network boundaries.

Title : Differentiated Services (DiffServ) and Real-time Communication Authors : Dan York David Black Cullen Jennings Paul Jones Filename : draft-york-dart-dscp-rtp-01.txt Pages : 19 Date : 2014-07-03 Abstract: This document describes the interaction between Differentiated Services (DiffServ) network quality of service (QoS) functionality and real-time network communication, including communication based on the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). DiffServ is based on network nodes applying different forwarding treatments to packets whose IP headers are marked with different DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs). As a result, use of different DSCPs within a single traffic stream may cause transport protocol interactions (e.g., reordering). In addition, DSCP markings may be changed or removed between the traffic source and destination. This document covers the implications of these DiffServ aspects for real-time network communication, including RTCWEB.

The recommendations are reasonable and reasonably argued, but the precision and specificity of the language needs to be tightened up before publication. The below addresses some specific concerns. Section 2 nit: “communication in real-time” -> “communication in real time” nit: The complex example needs to mention that there may be non-media streams; suggest “there may be multiple media and non-media streams”. 2.1 Reference to SSRC for reference clock is wrong - “an RTP stream may contain multiple source streams that use the same reference clock (SSRC)” - this should be “clock, identified by the same CNAME”. The SSRC has to be different for each RTP stream in an RTP session. (The naming choice here is confusing….) The section needs to mention that RTP can be carried over a non-datagram protocol such as TCP, but that this document does not say more about this - just to show that its omission is deliberate, not accidental. (In fact 5.3 discusses TCP-encapsulated RTP. So it’s appropriate to mention it here.) STUN is not an encapsulation protocol, so should be omitted from the “encapsulated via STUN” sentence. TURN is. STUN packets are, however, multiplexed with the RTP packets. Agree that the UDP stream is not unidirectional. 2.2 STUN\/TURN paragraph sits oddly here. It seems to belong outside the “reasons for multiplexing” flow. Perhaps move it to the beginning of the section? Again, STUN description needs tuning; STUN is used also for enabling communication without a relay server, by exchanging publicly-visible IP addresses and ports. 4. “receiving the audio packets ahead of the video is not useful” -> “is not very useful” - the next sentence gives a reason why it is somewhat useful. 5.1 Diffserv, Reordering and Transport Protocols The paragraph “Reordering also affects other forms of congestion control” is wrong. The content is OK, but the intro is not - it is the differential treatment (including drop probability) that creates problems for RMCAT, not (just) the reordering. DCCP is sensitive to differential treatment, since it does congestion control, so description of it as “problem free” is wrong. I think there are considerations coming from reordering (which affect protocols with immediate feedback, such as ACK-based protocols), and there are consdierations from diferential treatment (guessing wrong about what’s affected by a queue). The former applies to TCP; the latter applies to TCP, SCTP, DCCP, and (probably) whatever RMCAT comes to. These two should be separated. 5.2 DiffServ, reordering and real time communication The last paragraph of the section is somewhat misleading - network packet reordering done for *whatever* reason has no upper bound. If the authors think that packet reordering is more likely to be problematic with different DSCPs than with the same DSCP, that’s what they should say. The reference to RTCP multi-stream optimization seems completely wrong. The grouping into RTCP reporting groups is about receiver SSRCs that see the same set of packets, not about grouping reports about different SSRC together. (unless I’ve misunderstood something). When not using multi-stream optimization, these SSRCs send duplicate reports. 6. Guidelines The word “requirements” seems at odds with the headline “guidelines”. The word “session” is used several times without explanation - “RTCP session”, “reliable transport protoocol session”. From context, I guess “flow” or “connection” would be more appropriate. I wonder if the first requirement can be phrased in the positive? For instance: * Within a single RTP stream, should use a single PHB and DSCP, or a set of PHBs and DSCPs that do not allow reordering, for instance a single AF class. All in all, the document*'s recommendations are clear and reasonable, but the document can be improved. * * -- Surveillance is pervasive. Go Dark.

So it’s appropriate to mention it here.) STUN is not an encapsulation protocol, so should be omitted from the “encapsulated via STUN” sentence. TURN is. STUN packets are, however, multiplexed with the RTP packets. Agree that the UDP stream is not unidirectional. 2.2 STUN\/TURN paragraph sits oddly here. It seems to belong outside the “reasons for multiplexing” flow. Perhaps move it to the beginning of the section?Again, STUN description needs tuning; STUN is used also for enabling communication without a relay server, by exchanging publicly-visible IP addresses and ports. 4. “receiving the audio packets ahead of the video is not useful” -> “is not very useful” - the next sentence gives a reason why it is somewhat useful. 5.1 Diffserv, Reordering and Transport Protocols The paragraph “Reordering also affects other forms of congestion control” is wrong. The content is OK, but the intro is not - it is the differential treatment (including drop probability) that creates problems for RMCAT, not (just) the reordering. DCCP is sensitive to differential treatment, since it does congestion control, so description of it as “problem free” is wrong. I think there are considerations coming from reordering (which affect protocols with immediate feedback, such as ACK-based protocols), and there are consdierations from diferential treatment (guessing wrong about what’s affected by a queue). The former applies to TCP; the latter applies to TCP, SCTP, DCCP, and (probably) whatever RMCAT comes to. These two should be separated. 5.2 DiffServ, reordering and real time communication The last paragraph of the section is somewhat misleading - network packet reordering done for *whatever* reason has no upper bound. If the authors think that packet reordering is more likely to be problematic with different DSCPs than with the same DSCP, that’s what they should say. The reference to RTCP multi-stream optimization seems completely wrong. The grouping into RTCP reporting groups is about receiver SSRCs that see the same set of packets, not about grouping reports about different SSRC together. (unless I’ve misunderstood something). When not using multi-stream optimization, these SSRCs send duplicate reports. 6. Guidelines The word “requirements” seems at odds with the headline “guidelines”. The word “session” is used several times without explanation - “RTCP session”, “reliable transport protoocol session”. From context, I guess “flow” or “connection” would be more appropriate. I wonder if the first requirement can be phrased in the positive? For instance: * Within a single RTP stream, should use a single PHB and DSCP, or a set of PHBs and DSCPs that do not allow reordering, for instance a single AF class. All in all, the document's recommendations are clear and reasonable, but the document can be improved. -- Surveillance is pervasive. Go Dark."}

SD: Agreed. The previous line states: \" Therefore, the DSCP value may be remarked at the network edge through policy to any other DSCP value, including best effort.\". There is already a mention that apckers may be remarked or dropped and any additional mitigation is outside the scope of this draft. Unfortunately, this doesn't address my comment. DSCP remarking by provider policy is somewhat different from having policers installed (e.g., a token bucket w\/ marker and dropper) that perform traffic conditioning according to some installed traffic profile. Static remarking of DSCPs may be caused by using a different DCSP\/PHB mapping or lack of DiffServ support etc. which is slightly different. The problem with using EF is that if too many EF marked packets are injected into a DS domain, they probably void the EF properties for other users within this domain (background is that the service rate of EF packets on a given output interface must exceed their arrival rate at that interface over long and short time intervals - this is usually checked by admission control before use and policing at DS boundary nodes during use). Therefore, maybe some discussion w.r.t. RFC5865 http:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc5865 may be useful. SD: Agreed that admission control is very useful and relevant. This draft is intended for the selection and use of the right DSCP for webrtc media flows. There is a mention of over-subscription in the beginning. Sure, however, my point was that simply injecting traffic marked with a DSCP for a PHB that normally requires prior admission control is somewhat problematic: either guarantees for already admitted flows are violated or such traffic has to be dropped. If a packet enters a QoS domain that has no support for the above defined Data Types\/Application (service) classes, then the network node at the edge will remark the DSCP value based on policies. Yes, but even if there is support for these classes traffic conditioning (e.g., remarking\/dropping etc.) may be necessary and applied. Remarking to different PHBs may also lead to packet reordering within a media flow?! SD: Remarking\/dropping may occur, which is mentioned in the draft. Same issue as above: remarking caused by a static DS domain policy (PHBx -> PHBy) is different from remarking and other actions that boundary nodes may perform for individual flows according to traffic profiles.

DiffServ and RTCP The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) [RFC3550] is used with RTP to monitor quality of service and convey information about RTP session participants. A sender of RTCP packets that also sends RTP packets (i.e., originates an RTP stream) should use the same DSCP marking for both types of packets. If an RTCP sender doesn't send any RTP packets, it should mark its RTCP packets with the DSCP that it would use if it did send RTP packets. If the RTCP sender uses or would use multiple DSCPs that differ only in drop precedence for RTP, then it should use the DSCP with the least likelihood of drop for RTCP to increase the likelihood of RTCP packet delivery. This looks okay (the correction in your next message is good also). You might also add something along the lines of \"If the SDP bundle extension [cite] is used to negotiate sending multiple types of media in a single RTP session, then the receivers will send separate RTCP reports for each type of media, using a separate SSRC for each media type; those RTCP reports need to be marked with the DSCP corresponding to the type of media handled by the reporting SSRC.\" This guidance may result in different DSCP markings for RTP streams and RTCP receiver reports about those RTP streams. The resulting variation in network QoS treatment by traffic direction could result in unrepresentative round trip time (RTT) estimates that don't correspond to consistent network QoS treatment in both directions. I don't think this is a problem. The media doesn't get consistent network QoS treatment in both directions, and the RTCP is trying to sample the RTT seen by the media, so this is fine. RTCP receiver reports may be relatively infrequent (e.g., may be sent only once per video frame rendered) and hence the resulting RTT estimates are of limited utility for congestion control (although they have other important uses, see [RFC3550]). For this reason, it is not important that RTCP receiver reports receive the same network QoS treatment as the RTP stream or streams being reported on. RTCP multi-stream reporting optimizations for an RTP session [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-multi-stream-optimisation] assume that the RTP streams involved experience the same network behavior, including packet loss. This mechanism is highly inappropriate when the RTP streams involved use different DSCPs, even if the corresponding PHBs differ solely in drop precedence. This could maybe say \"received RTP streams\", since it's okay to use the rtp- multi-stream-optimisation if you send with different DSCPs (the optimisation is optimising how you send reports about what you receive). 6. Guidelines [... snip ...] o Should use a single DSCP for RTCP packets, which should be a DSCP used for RTP packets that are or would be sent by the same sender, see Section 5.4. Perhaps \"Each SSRC should use a single DSCP for RTCP ... used by RTP packets that are or would be sent by that SSRC...\"? Just \"sender\" could be ambiguous, since an endpoint could be a sender for several streams, each of which has a separate SSRC and could use a different DSCP. -- Colin Perkins http:\/\/csperkins.org\/ _______________________________________________ Dart mailing list Dart@ietf.org https:\/\/www.ietf.org\/mailman\/listinfo\/dart"}

I'm not aware of whether such a decision has been made. Ben, Colin, On (2) below, it might be a challenge to get agreement quickly, but it might be nice if we could. As this work relates to RMCAT, determining one-way delay or changes thereto will likely prove important. In general, I would expect perceived quality to be important and conveying quality metrics and\/or providing feedback to the sender so that perceived quality improves (in whatever form) will be important. I'm suspicious of use of any RTT calculation for any mechanism that might be used to improve QoE. If so, then we should document the potential impact. If _not_, then it seems to me the best we could do is mention that RTCP treatments may or may not have an impact on RTT estimates, and that the implementer should think about it. If accurate RTT measurements could be made, they could be useful. The problem is that in some environments, we know that RTTs will not be accurate. Sometimes they are, of course. We could have some text as you suggest, but I would personally prefer we not encourage use of RTT values for any particular purpose. :-) Getting feedback to the sender is important, though. In an ideal world, I would argue that RTCP packets should be marked with whatever DSCP value will deliver RTCP packets in the most expedient way. Since we don't have an ideal world, I don't know which DSCP value that would be. Would the starting positions of \"getting feedback is important, even of not for RTT estimates\" and \"we need RTCP for RTT estimates\" likely land on the same guidance for DSCP values? The argument to send RTCP packets in the most expedient way sounds reasonable. I don't know if we need to recommend a particular DSCP, since we already have quite a bit of text on how DSCPs might (or might not) map into some predictable PHB treatment. Good question and valid point. Nowhere in the document do we recommend the use of a particular DSCP value for any particular thing, and we should not recommend a particular value for RTCP in this document. I'm just not sure what statements should be made. I suspect we can all agree that RTCP information is important. It's just the DSCP-related guidance that goes with that that is challenging.

Title : Differentiated Services (DiffServ) and Real-time CommunicHtion Authors : David Black Paul Jones Filename : draft-ietf-dart-dscp-rtp-04.txt Pages : 26 Date : 2014-08-25 Abstract: This document describes the interaction between Differentiated Services (DiffServ) network quality of service (QoS) functionality and real-time network communication, including communication based on the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). DiffServ is based on network nodes applying different forwarding treatments to packets whose IP headers are marked with different DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs). WebRTC applications, as well as some conferencing applications, have begun using the Session Description Protocol (SDP) bundle negotiation mechanism to send multiple traffic streams with different QoS requirments using the same network 5-tuple. Use of different DSCPs to obtain different QoS treatments within a single network 5-tuple, the results (e.g., reordering) may cause transport protocol interactions, particularly with congestion control functionality. In addition, DSCP markings may be changed or removed between the traffic source and destination. This document covers the implications of these DiffServ aspects for real-time network communication, including WebRTC.

Between \"packet stream\" and \"MediaStream\" and \"Media Stream\" (yeah, those are different, too), the language makes it hard to follow. Your issue has been understood and will be addressed. In fact, Bo has already sent an email confirming that this change will be made for the next version: \"Change the term “Packet Stream” to “RTP Stream” throughout the document, since “Packet Stream” is too unspecific\" Cheers, Gonzalo The term \"media flow\" doesn't sound to me like a good term to use for this concept. Would the authors be willing to consider switching to \"packet stream\"? I don't have a strong preference, except that I'd prefer to qualify that as \"RTP Packet Stream\".

My thought that was if Alice and Bob are sending flows to each other and Bob is sending audio using EF, then when Bob sends out a Sender Report, the packet would be marked EF. The way this is worded, if Alice is sending packets using CS0, then Bob would mark his SR's using CS0. I'm not sure how to handle the RR's, though, particularly of a receive-only device. We could say it would be the same as the flow being reported on, but there might be 31 such flows being reported on. Perhaps if there is agreement that the RTCP packets will be marked in the same way as the sender would send its media, then we say the reports should be marked in the same was as it would if it did send media. So, do we want RTCP packets to be marked the same as the media flow transmitted or the same as the received media flow?

Since we don't have an ideal world, I don't know which DSCP value that would be. Would the starting positions of \"getting feedback is important, even of not for RTT estimates\" and \"we need RTCP for RTT estimates\" likely land on the same guidance for DSCP values? The argument to send RTCP packets in the most expedient way sounds reasonable. I don't know if we need to recommend a particular DSCP, since we already have quite a bit of text on how DSCPs might (or might not) map into some predictable PHB treatment. Good question and valid point. Nowhere in the document do we recommend the use of a particular DSCP value for any particular thing, and we should not recommend a particular value for RTCP in this document. I'm just not sure what statements should be made. I suspect we can all agree that RTCP information is important. It's just the DSCP-related guidance that goes with that that is challenging. I don’t agree that RTCP information should be sent as higher priority than the media. Ideally, it should be sent with the same priority as the media, so it can be used to sample the RTT. This RTT sample is independent of RMCAT. It’s in base RTP specification, and so is something we need to support to the extent possible. Since not all the media sent by a single SSRC has the same marking, my suggestion would be that each SSRC mark the RTCP packets it sends with one of the same code points as it uses to mark the media. Since RTCP is somewhat important, it would make sense for each SSRC to mark the RTCP packets it sends using the highest priority code point it uses to mark the RTP media packets it sends. That makes sense to me. Paul, and others, do you agree with that last paragraph? I agree that the value should be one of the values used for media, but the challenge is specifying which DSCP value to use. If audio is sent using EF, video as AF41, app sharing video as AF31, etc., which of these does the endpoint choose to use for RTCP? Since DSCP values cannot be assumed to any particular PHB behavior in the network, that makes answering that question challenging. My personal preference in a voice\/video conference would be to use the same marking as is used for those flows -- and I would use the same value for both voice and video. However, if the app sharing video is considered more important by some applications, perhaps that's the value that should be used in those applications. I can accept the suggestion, leaving the specific selection as an implementation matter. I do wish there was something more concrete so that two devices would always follow the same approach to selecting a value, but I doubt we can get agreement very quickly. Paul"}

As this work relates to RMCAT, determining one-way delay or changes thereto will likely prove important. In general, I would expect perceived quality to be important and conveying quality metrics and\/or providing feedback to the sender so that perceived quality improves (in whatever form) will be important. I'm suspicious of use of any RTT calculation for any mechanism that might be used to improve QoE. Getting feedback to the sender is important, though. In an ideal world, I would argue that RTCP packets should be marked with whatever DSCP value will deliver RTCP packets in the most expedient way. Since we don't have an ideal world, I don't know which DSCP value that would be. There are several options we could consider: * Mark all RTCP packets as CS0 * Mark RTCP packets using a locally-defined \"highest priority\" marking * Mark RTCP packets the same as media flow for the first (active) SDP line (thus, if audio is the first m= line in SDP and that flow is active, all RTCP packets will be marked the same as audio) * Specify a value for all RTCP packets irrespective of any value used in RTP flows I think the right folks on the thread and on the list are present to help make that choice.

I'm not sure what to say about this, as it looks like I need to set off a discussion (debate?) between you and my co-author, Paul Jones. Colin (from WGLC comments): Rather, within a single RTP session there are RTCP packets sent that give information about the RTP streams that are being sent, and that report on the reception quality of RTP streams being received. Using a single PHB and DSCP for all RTCP packets within an RTP session might make sense, but it's important to note that one role of RTCP is to provide an estimate of the round-trip time seen by the media, so the PHB\/DSCP will have to be chosen with care to avoid biasing that estimate too much. Paul (from shortly after the Toronto meeting: During the meeting, there was discussion of marking RTCP packets. Some notes I received on this topic suggested that it was proposed that RTCP should be marked the same as for RTP. The argument was that this is used for RTT calculations. If that is what was said, I'd like to state my disagreement. :-) The forward and reverse paths are not necessarily the same and there is nothing one should assume about the reverse path to provide guidance about the forward path (or vice versa). As perhaps a gross example, I have the ability to download far faster on my home Internet connection than I can upload. Other important traffic characteristics differ in each direction. Further, an RTCP packet might provide information related to several different RTP packets. I certainly would not want to see one RTCP packet per RTP packet. I'll watch where that discussion goes before proposing text. One of the uses of RTCP is certainly to estimate the round-trip time, as described in Section 6.4.1 (page 41) of RFC 3550. The DSCP marking used for RTCP does need to take this use into account. Ideally, this would mean RTCP packets were marked the same as the corresponding RTP packets, as I suggested in the meeting. However, Paul is correct that this only works when all RTP packets have the same marking. Accordingly, I’m not sure what the right marking is for RTCP. One approach might be to say that an SSRC that sends RTP packets with different marking should use marking with the highest(lowest?) precedence of those is uses for RTCP, so the RTT estimate calculated from RTCP is representative of some RTP packets. I’m not sure that using a single DSCP for all RTCP packets would achieve that. Can this working group reasonably answer this question? If not, we could list it as something implementors need to think about, and note that we do not have generic guidance."}

The IESG contact persons are Richard Barnes and Alissa Cooper. A URL of this Internet Draft is: http:\/\/datatracker.ietf.org\/doc\/draft-ietf-dart-dscp-rtp\/ Technical Summary This document describes the interaction between Differentiated Services (DiffServ) network quality of service (QoS) functionality and real-time network communication, including communication based on the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). DiffServ is based on network nodes applying different forwarding treatments to packets whose IP headers are marked with different DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs). WebRTC applications, as well as some conferencing applications, have begun using the Session Description Protocol (SDP) bundle negotiation mechanism to send multiple traffic streams with different QoS requirements using the same network 5-tuple. Use of different DSCPs to obtain different QoS treatments within a single network 5-tuple, the results (e.g., reordering) may cause transport protocol interactions, particularly with congestion control functionality. In addition, DSCP markings may be changed or removed between the traffic source and destination. This document covers the implications of these DiffServ aspects for real-time network communication, including WebRTC. Working Group Summary The DART working group was formed in April of 2014. The working group was chartered to focus on a constrained problem and conclude quickly. DART adopted this document with very little controversy. While the working group is nominally in the RAI area, it has been effectively a cross-area effort between RAI and TSV. This document resulted in lively discussion among a core group of experts from both areas. In general, the discussion converged quickly, and there were no unresolved controversies. In the shepherd's opinion, the only impediment to consensus was that discussion kept overturning rocks, forcing participants to think about new issues. One notable issue was whether this draft should offer guidance on the interaction between having multiple DSCPs in a stream and the multiple stream optimization work (draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-multi-stream-optimisation.) The working group chose to avoid such guidance in this draft, and leave that for the multi-stream draft to solve. Document Quality During the working group last call, we solicited comments from RTCWEB, AVTCORE, MMUSIC, CLUE, TSVWG, and RMCAT. In the shepherd's opinion, it has been well reviewed, and represents a strong consensus. The shepherd does not think it needs any further specific reviews, other than the usual reviews it would receive during the IETF last call process (for example, Gen-ART and SecDir). Since the document does not specify protocol, it will not be directly implemented. However, we expect that at least the RTCWEB working group will incorporate guidance from this document into it's output. Personnel The Document Shepherd is Ben Campbell.

The problem is that the way the WebRTC APIs are structured, it's not necessarily clear to an application that its media traffic is indeed going over TCP, so it might make precedence requests that the browser implementing the APIs can't (and shouldn't try to) satisfy. The question is how the browser should behave when that happens. I spoke to Cullen about this, offline, after the DART session, and I believe he had a simple proposal. Jonathan, Let's briefly discuss your point below: Different drop precedences are required if congestion within a PHB group may occur. TCP is designed for reliable transport. In case of a loss, TCP will reduce bandwidth and retransmit the dropped information. I'm not an RTP expert. The few applications known to me don't seem to benefit from such a behavior, if a single application flow uses different drop precedence levels in combination with TCP. It may make sense to have different TCP flows marked by different drop precedences. The less important TCP flows get throttled in the case of congestion. But is there a need to avoid re-ordering across different drop precedences, which is an AF PHB group feature? Again, I'm not an RTP expert - but that doesn't sound like making a lot of sense too. In general, I'd be interested to learn, if some applications were benefitting from ECN (or a congestion indication by marking rather than by dropping).

Indeed not, and that's on the assumption that the receiving domain even operates an AF service class. The worst case assumption is that everything reverts to best effort somewhere along the path. That's a fairly benign case, actually. The worst case is that DSCP priorities get remapped in a way that inverts drop precedence (see the draft's discussion about less-than-best-effort). I hope that's not a case that's so frequent that we have to worry over-much about it."}

The text: This guidance may result in different DSCP markings for RTP streams and RTCP receiver reports about those RTP streams. The resulting variation in network QoS treatment by traffic direction could result in unrepresentative round trip time (RTT) estimates that don't correspond to consistent network QoS treatment in both directions. RTCP receiver reports may be relatively infrequent (e.g., may be sent only once per video frame rendered) and hence the resulting RTT estimates are of limited utility for congestion control (although they have other important uses, see [RFC3550]). For this reason, it is not important that RTCP receiver reports receive the same network QoS treatment as the RTP stream or streams being reported on. suggests that the RTT estimate derived from RTCP will be unrepresentative, since it may not have consistent network QoS in each direction. However, since the RTP media packets can use different QoS in each direction, the RTCP also needs to do so, to be representative! If the media used different QoS markings for different directions and the RTCP used the same marking, the RTT estimate wouldn’t match that of the media. I suggest the paragraph be changed to: This guidance may result in different DSCP markings for RTP streams and the RTCP packets reporting on those RTP streams. The resulting variation in network QoS treatment by traffic direction is necessary to get representative round trip time (RTT) estimates that correspond to the media path RTT. RTCP receiver reports may be relatively infrequent and hence the resulting RTT estimates are of limited utility for congestion control (although they have other important uses, see [RFC3550]). For this reason, it is important that RTCP receiver reports sent by an SSRC receive the same network QoS treatment as the RTP stream being sent by that SSRC.

I'm about to vanish for about 3 weeks, but could put in a revised -06 over the weekend if you can quickly convince Colin. Explicitly pinging Colin - Colin, are you arguing that the sentence RTCP multi-stream reporting optimizations for an RTP session [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-multi-stream-optimisation] assume that the RTP streams involved experience the same packet loss behavior. This mechanism is highly inappropriate when the RTP streams involved use different PHBs, even if those PHBs differ solely in drop precedence. should stay in the draft? I was, but thinking again, I'm not so sure. I think this recommendation is wrong. I can't find anything in your latest messages that speak to this particular point. You're one of the authors of -multi-stream, so you should be able to speak clearly to the point. Can you clarify? If I have several SSRCs, and receive several media streams, then provided each of my SSRCs sees the exact same quality for each received stream, then I can use the multi-stream-optimisation to reduce the number of RTCP cross reports I send. The multi-stream-optimisation draft says that already, and it's not clear that the DART drafts needs to say anything further on the topic. Whether I use the same DSCP for all RTCP reports I send is, I think, orthogonal to whether I use the multi-stream-optimisation. The dart draft should possibly say that, but I'm not sure that's the sentence we have above. I read the sentence above as saying flatly and unconditionally \"don't use multi-stream-optimization when the RTP streams have different PHBs\" - which means that if I want to use one PHB for audio and another PHB for video, I can't use multi-stream-optimization. I'd be sad if that was the case, *especially* if we can't figure out any reason to make that recommendation. _______________________________________________ Dart mailing list Dart@ietf.org https:\/\/www.ietf.org\/mailman\/listinfo\/dart -- Colin Perkins http:\/\/csperkins.org\/"}

I would've liked to have used \"media stream\" for the former, but W3C has defined MediaStream to not be a single stream of media (go figure ...). \"media flow\" seemed to be as good a term as any for that concept, and \"media flow\" is already used for that concept in draft-ietf-tsvwg-rtcweb-qos (i.e., it was not invented for this draft).

Great - thanks for taking a look. If a MediaStream is carried in a RTP session, the text may also explicitely say that (it says MediaStreamTrack == media flow, which is carried in an individual RTP packet stream) As I read Section 11 of draft-ietf-rtcweb-rtp-usage-15, for RTCWEB, that would happen only when the MediaStream contains exactly one MediaStreamTrack. The use of these terms in bullet item 1 in section 2 is intended to be specific to RTCWEB, but we could add text elsewhere to point out that non-RTCWEB usage of MediaStreams could use an RTP packet stream for each Media Stream, independent of how many MediaStreamTracks each MediaStream contains. Could you suggest a reference that could be cited for usage of an RTP packet stream for each MediaStream independent of how many MediaStreamTracks each MediaStream contains? Careful - \"RTP packet stream\" is one of those concepts that can be meaningless without citing a specific definition. draft-ietf-avtext-rtp-grouping-taxonomy is probably the best reference at the moment. It says this about \"Packet stream\": 2.1.10. Packet Stream A stream of RTP packets containing media data, source or redundant. The Packet Stream is identified by an SSRC belonging to a particular RTP session. The RTP session is identified as discussed in Section 2.2.2. Under this definition, it's impossible to put more than one MediaStreamTrack into a packet stream. In a lot of cases (FEC, redundancy, SVC, simulcast), there will be multiple RTP packet streams associated with one MediaStreamTrack. The term is used only once in the draft, but unfortunately defines a new term to mean the same thing: The most common protocol used for real time media is the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP)[RFC3550]. RTP defines the mechanism by which real-time data is transmitted between hosts on the Internet. With most applications, a single media type (e.g., audio) is transmitted within a single RTP session. However, it is possible to transmit multiple, distinct media flows over the same RTP session as individual RTP packet streams. This is referred to as RTP multiplexing. For the purposes of this draft, the term \"media flow\" refers to a sequence of packets that is transmitted as a single RTP packet stream. The term \"media flow\" doesn't sound to me like a good term to use for this concept.

I've copied in some text of RFC3246 related to EF remarking and policing below. My take: . remarking of entire flows is an option, but no remarking of packets exceeding EF capacity limits. - looking at the EF jitter and delay properties, I doubt that shaping is desirable. RFC3246 doesn't mention shaping as part of EF conditioning. I personally wouldn't expect EF shaping in sections where policing is applied. - dropping of packets exceeding EF capacity is a MUST, if I interpret RFC3246 correctly. I suggest to adapt the section of draft-dart-dscp to be more precise regarding the optional remarking of EF traffic and to remove shaping as a conditioning option if traffic is beyond the EF forwarding capacity limit. A Proposal for the final sentence: ...exceeds that capacity must be dropped. EF compliant flows may be remarked to a different DSCP. All other new text indicated by the Diff version looks allright. Regards, Ruediger draft-dart-dscp: 3. Expedited Forwarding (EF) [RFC3246] intended for inelastic traffic. Beyond the basic EF PHB, the VOICE-ADMIT PHB [RFC5865] is an admission controlled variant of the EF PHB. Both of these PHBs are based on pre-configured limited forwarding capacity; traffic that exceeds that capacity may be shaped, remarked to a different DSCP, or dropped. ######################################## RFC3246 (three excerpts): Packets belonging to a single microflow within the EF aggregate passing through a device SHOULD NOT experience re-ordering in normal operation of the device. Packets marked for EF PHB MAY be remarked at a DS domain boundary only to other codepoints that satisfy the EF PHB. Packets marked for EF PHBs SHOULD NOT be demoted or promoted to another PHB by a DS domain. If the EF PHB is implemented by a mechanism that allows unlimited preemption of other traffic (e.g., a priority queue), the implementation MUST include some means to limit the damage EF traffic could inflict on other traffic (e.g., a token bucket rate limiter). Traffic that exceeds this limit MUST be discarded. -----Ursprüngliche Nachricht----- Von: Dart [mailto:dart-bounces@ietf.org] Im Auftrag von Ben Campbell Gesendet: Samstag, 9.

The use of these terms in bullet item 1 in section 2 is intended to be specific to RTCWEB, but we could add text elsewhere to point out that non-RTCWEB usage of MediaStreams could use an RTP packet stream for each Media Stream, independent of how many MediaStreamTracks each MediaStream contains. Could you suggest a reference that could be cited for usage of an RTP packet stream for each MediaStream independent of how many MediaStreamTracks each MediaStream contains? Is the following correct: UDP_5-tuple-+--transport protocol 1----- | +--RTP session 1----- | +--RTP session 2-----+---RTP_stream_2.1 | +---RTP_stream_2.2 |... Yes, that matches my understanding, although the author team would like to see discussion of whether it's a good idea to mix RTP and non-RTP protocols on the same 5-tuple - I'll copy your useful diagram into a separate message to start that discussion. The question coming to my mind is, whether your team can add a statement how many AF classes are useful to carry different RTP sessions within one UDP flow. See draft-ietf-tsvwg-rtcweb-qos-00, which proposes to make all four AF classes available, so we can expect that someone will try to use all of them (and everything else in that draft). OTOH, we did put this warning text in at the end of Section 2.4 of draft-york: Backbone and other carrier networks may employ a small number of DSCPs (e.g., less than half a dozen) in order to manage a small number of traffic aggregates; hosts that use a larger number of DSCPs may find that much of the intended differentiation is removed by such networks. What additional text would you suggest that we add?

This is impressive on first sight for a non-application expert. If the number of RTP (and other transport) streams is high, I doubt that DiffServ is able to support more than rough differentiation. DiffServ is designed to aggregate traffic of similar requirements. Fine grained differentiation should be part of the application.

In general I agree; but that only makes sense if there is an agreement (or mechanism) to define the nominal rate, and rate control of some kind at the source. (An IP phone is in effect a rate controller, for example.) A rate scheduler with single digit millisecond buffer depth and tail drop like behavior is not an issue. To me, that's a shaper configured to be EF compliant. If such a constraint is not desired then the text may say \"if mapped to a non-EF PHB, excess traffic may be shaped\". I'd like to ask for some explaining text if shaping of EF excess traffic is regarded as a property to be expected for this PHB. Yes, technically that's correct - but a shaper could be inserted at the boundary between two DS domains, and for the end-to-end user that will appear as a property of the PHB. If an AF class is used to transport EF, then any potential remarking should be done in a way avoiding re-ordering (i.e. remark to DSCPs within the same AF class only). There's no point in remarking excess EF traffic to a PHB which may cause reordering. I fully agree. I think that's what a text on remarking of EF should express, if remarking is kept as an option to be expected (I've not yet heard of such a deployment). Yes. I'm not advocating such behaviour; my point is only that EF may not always be strictly conformant to RFC 3246.

I've copied in some text of RFC3246 related to EF remarking and policing below. My take: . remarking of entire flows is an option, but no remarking of packets exceeding EF capacity limits. - looking at the EF jitter and delay properties, I doubt that shaping is desirable. RFC3246 doesn't mention shaping as part of EF conditioning. I personally wouldn't expect EF shaping in sections where policing is applied. - dropping of packets exceeding EF capacity is a MUST, if I interpret RFC3246 correctly. Well, it seems to me to be a SHOULD, with the MUST that you cite below being conditional on \"a mechanism that allows unlimited preemption of other traffic.\" So I would not be at all surprised by deployments that support shaping and remarking. Also, there are certainly implementations that are closer to RFC 2598 or RFC 3248 and therefore less strict. I think the draft should make it clear that there is likely to be variation in actual behaviour for EF traffic that exceeds the nominal rate. (Leaving aside the fact that without a string of matching SLAs along the path, the nominal rate might not even be well defined.) Brian I suggest to adapt the section of draft-dart-dscp to be more precise regarding the optional remarking of EF traffic and to remove shaping as a conditioning option if traffic is beyond the EF forwarding capacity limit. A Proposal for the final sentence: ...exceeds that capacity must be dropped. EF compliant flows may be remarked to a different DSCP. All other new text indicated by the Diff version looks allright. Regards, Ruediger draft-dart-dscp: 3. Expedited Forwarding (EF) [RFC3246] intended for inelastic traffic. Beyond the basic EF PHB, the VOICE-ADMIT PHB [RFC5865] is an admission controlled variant of the EF PHB. Both of these PHBs are based on pre-configured limited forwarding capacity; traffic that exceeds that capacity may be shaped, remarked to a different DSCP, or dropped. ######################################## RFC3246 (three excerpts): Packets belonging to a single microflow within the EF aggregate passing through a device SHOULD NOT experience re-ordering in normal operation of the device. Packets marked for EF PHB MAY be remarked at a DS domain boundary only to other codepoints that satisfy the EF PHB. Packets marked for EF PHBs SHOULD NOT be demoted or promoted to another PHB by a DS domain. If the EF PHB is implemented by a mechanism that allows unlimited preemption of other traffic (e.g., a priority queue), the implementation MUST include some means to limit the damage EF traffic could inflict on other traffic (e.g., a token bucket rate limiter). Traffic that exceeds this limit MUST be discarded. -----Ursprüngliche Nachricht----- Von: Dart [mailto:dart-bounces@ietf.org] Im Auftrag von Ben Campbell Gesendet: Samstag, 9.

I see a potential problem here, if this becomes a default: If widely deployed using EF, the traffic will likely result in this DSCP being ignored\/dropped (not given you EF properties0)or in breaking EF properties for other flows (which needs to be policed). If you look at RFC3246 (the EF specification) you will find these words: the rate at which EF traffic is served at a given output interface should be at least the configured rate R, over a suitably defined interval, independent of the offered load of non-EF traffic to that interface.

You've asked for information on what's implemented today and that's what I've provided. Each AF DSCP identifies an individual PHB. If classification is DSCP based and limits apply on the number of PHBs, that's what providers have to respect. This limit still applies, if e.g. all AF4 packets are operated by the same scheduler (which I'd expect from a provider deployment). It is also somewhat demanding to configure 14 PHBs to support just rtcweb on a retail access and then provide additional PHBs for services of a provider. The provider may offer some services with admission control and if rtcweb isn't running through the same admission control, this requires additional PHBs. Some carriers may have deployed DiffServ already, when rtcweb starts to use it.

The desired treatment is to classify by DSCP, but put inbound traffic with three DSCPs for AF4x into one queue preserving packet order. The DiffServ term for this set of traffic that uses the three AF4x PHBs (with a DSCP for each) is \"ordered aggregate\" - see Section 5 of RFC 3260. After initial classification has separated out the ordered aggregate, it can be run through an AF remarker in order to condition the outbound proportions of AF41\/42\/43 to match some desired distribution.

Some vendors removed this option and with IPv6, each PHB must be classified and completely configured individually by DSCP. That's a good thing, since that behavior (per DSCP traffic handling) is a core element of the DiffServ architecture, and is required by RFC 2474 (Section 3). Please be aware, if it comes to a re-write, a single DSCP is set for all incoming DSCPs matching this PHB. Keep in mind the possible restrictions on the number of PHBs. Full AF support should classify all 3 PHBs that make up an AF class into a single aggregate on the node, with remarking applied to that aggregate, not DSCP by DSCP. If end-to-end DiffServ PHBs are what you look for, standardize what is really required and be clear on how to use it. As noted earlier, that's not the goal of the dart WG, as I understand it.

Please be aware, if it comes to a re-write, a single DSCP is set for all incoming DSCPs matching this PHB. Keep in mind the possible restrictions on the number of PHBs. - many IP\/MPLS backbone networks and also many Ethernet based access networks support 3-4 PHBs for retail services. I'm not aware of any two providers using exactly the same DSCPs. I'm also not aware of any two standards using fully matching DSCPs for their PHBs (IETF, GSMA, MEF). - There's something I'd call enterprise philosophy, that is making use of a large set of internal PHBs. I never saw any of these philosophies remotely resembling the other. PHBs or classes are used to identify products, access types, stream types and so on. These usually just consume PHBs with sometimes at best loose relation to standards. If end-to-end DiffServ PHBs are what you look for, standardise what is really required and be clear on how to use it. If a network provider is expected to support these PHBs, there must be a convincing reason to do so. Take EF as an example for a well specified DiffServ standard.

This note is an attempt to pick up non-editorial items that haven't been dealt with in other messages on the list. I see four of them: RG: [snip] [4] 2.4 DSCP remarking The discussion of token-bucket-based remarkers leaves me a bit confused. To me, it's obvious (?) that token-bucket-based remarkers would operate in color-blind mode on a network boundary, and in color-sensitive mode only when they had assurance that incoming markings were already indicating color. Thus, flows from an end-user system should only hit color-blind remarkers; the real question is: will a color-blind remarker use the incoming DSCP codepoint to decide which of a group of remarking treatments it chooses for the packets? I'm not sure about the \"obvious\" point - anyone care to comment on what's actually deployed\/configured in practice? The answer to the final question about choice of remarking treatment is \"yes\" although the PHBs in an AF class should receive the same treatment. The fact that the question was asked suggests that the discussion of traffic classifiers needs some additional clarity and explanation.

The four bullet points in Section 2.1 that follow \"The RTCWEB protocol suit encompasses a number of forms of multiplexing\" seem to confuse RTP sessions, RTCP, and transport-layer flows. I suggest they be changed to: The RTP streams that comprise a WebRTC session can be multiplexed together in a number of ways: 1. Individual source streams are carried in one or more individual RTP streams. These RTP streams can be multiplexed onto a single transport-layer flow or sent as separate transport-layer flows. This memo only considers the case where the RTP streams are to be multiplexed onto a single transport-layer flow, forming a single RTP session; 2. The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) [RFC3550] may be multiplexed onto the same transport-layer flow as the RTP stream with which it is associated, as described in [RFC5761], or it may be sent on a separate transport-layer flow; 3. The RTP and RTCP traffic can be multiplexed with other protocols via UDP encapsulation over a common pair of UDP ports as described in [RFC5764] as updated by [I-D.petithuguenin-avtcore-rfc5764-mux-fixes]; and 4. The data may be further encapsulated via STUN [RFC5389] and TURN [RFC5766] for NAT (Network Address Translator) traversal. In the following paragraph (penultimate paragraph in Section 2.1), I suggest changing \"unidirectional UDP packet flow\" to \"transport-layer flow\" since it will not be unidirectional (since RTCP also flows in the reverse direction), and might not use UDP. In the first paragraph of section 2.2, I suggest changing \"multiplexed over RTP sessions\" to \"multiplexed in a single RTP session\" and \"multiplexing of source streams in RTP sessions\" to \"multiplexing of source streams in a single RTP session\". In Section 6, the second bullet point refers to \"an RTCP session\". There is no such thing. Rather, within a single RTP session there are RTCP packets sent that give information about the RTP streams that are being sent, and that report on the reception quality of RTP streams being received. Using a single PHB and DSCP for all RTCP packets within an RTP session might make sense, but it's important to note that one role of RTCP is to provide an estimate of the round-trip time seen by the media, so the PHB\/DSCP will have to be chosen with care to avoid biasing that estimate too much.

Cheers, Colin Hi, The DART working group has started a last call for draft-ietf-dart-dscp-rtp- 02, ending on August 22. This informational draft describes considerations for the use of DiffServ code points in situations where one multiplexes multiple RTP packet streams, and potentially other protocol streams, that share the same 5-tuple.

However, SCTP performs congestion control and retransmission across the entire association, and not on a per-stream basis. Although there may be advantages to using multiple drop precedence across SCTP streams or within an SCTP stream that does not use reliable ordered delivery, there is no practical operational experience in doing so (e.g., the SCTP sockets API [RFC6458] does not support use of more than one DSCP for an SCTP association). As a consequence, the impacts on SCTP protocol and implementation behavior are unknown and difficult to predict. Hence a single PHB and DSCP should be used for all packets in an SCTP association, independent of the number or nature of streams in that association. Similar reasoning applies to a DCCP connection; a single PHB and DSCP should be used because the scope of congestion control is the connection and there is no operational experience with using more than one PHB or DSCP. I propose to add the following new sentence as its own paragraph: Guidance on transport protocol design and implementation to provide support for use of multiple PHBs and DSCPs in a transport connection (e.g., DCCP) or association (e.g., SCTP) is out of scope for this document.

The more DSCPs appear in a flow which aren't deployed end-to-end for the corresponding PHB, the more often one of the scenarios will be encountered. The following scenarios start from a domain sending IP traffic using a PHB and a corresponding DSCP to an interconnected domain. The receiving domain may - Support the PHB and offer the same corresponding DSCP - Not support the PHB and use the DSCP for a different PHB - Not support the PHB and not use the DSCP - Support the PHB with a differing DSCP, and the DSCP of the sending domain is not used for another PHB - Support the PHB with a differing DSCP, and the DSCP of the sending domain is used for another PHB Another question to be answered then is how a network provider will treat unrecognized or unexpected DSCPs received at network boundaries.

An SSRC should use the same marking it would use to send packets, and not the marking of the received packets.

A receive-only device should mark in the way it would if it sent media, I agree.

In an ideal world, I would argue that RTCP packets should be marked with whatever DSCP value will deliver RTCP packets in the most expedient way. Since we don't have an ideal world, I don't know which DSCP value that would be. Would the starting positions of \"getting feedback is important, even of not for RTT estimates\" and \"we need RTCP for RTT estimates\" likely land on the same guidance for DSCP values? The argument to send RTCP packets in the most expedient way sounds reasonable. I don't know if we need to recommend a particular DSCP, since we already have quite a bit of text on how DSCPs might (or might not) map into some predictable PHB treatment. Good question and valid point. Nowhere in the document do we recommend the use of a particular DSCP value for any particular thing, and we should not recommend a particular value for RTCP in this document. I'm just not sure what statements should be made. I suspect we can all agree that RTCP information is important. It's just the DSCP-related guidance that goes with that that is challenging. I don't agree that RTCP information should be sent as higher priority than the media. Ideally, it should be sent with the same priority as the media, so it can be used to sample the RTT. This RTT sample is independent of RMCAT. It's in base RTP specification, and so is something we need to support to the extent possible. Since not all the media sent by a single SSRC has the same marking, my suggestion would be that each SSRC mark the RTCP packets it sends with one of the same code points as it uses to mark the media.

One approach might be to say that an SSRC that sends RTP packets with different marking should use marking with the highest(lowest?) precedence of those is uses for RTCP, so the RTT estimate calculated from RTCP is representative of some RTP packets. I’m not sure that using a single DSCP for all RTCP packets would achieve that. Can this working group reasonably answer this question?

As this work relates to RMCAT, determining one-way delay or changes thereto will likely prove important. In general, I would expect perceived quality to be important and conveying quality metrics and\/or providing feedback to the sender so that perceived quality improves (in whatever form) will be important. I'm suspicious of use of any RTT calculation for any mechanism that might be used to improve QoE. If so, then we should document the potential impact. If _not_, then it seems to me the best we could do is mention that RTCP treatments may or may not have an impact on RTT estimates, and that the implementer should think about it. Getting feedback to the sender is important, though. In an ideal world, I would argue that RTCP packets should be marked with whatever DSCP value will deliver RTCP packets in the most expedient way. Since we don't have an ideal world, I don't know which DSCP value that would be. Would the starting positions of \"getting feedback is important, even of not for RTT estimates\" and \"we need RTCP for RTT estimates\" likely land on the same guidance for DSCP values? The argument to send RTCP packets in the most expedient way sounds reasonable. I don't know if we need to recommend a particular DSCP, since we already have quite a bit of text on how DSCPs might (or might not) map into some predictable PHB treatment. There are several options we could consider: * Mark all RTCP packets as CS0 * Mark RTCP packets using a locally-defined \"highest priority\" marking * Mark RTCP packets the same as media flow for the first (active) SDP line (thus, if audio is the first m= line in SDP and that flow is active, all RTCP packets will be marked the same as audio) * Specify a value for all RTCP packets irrespective of any value used in RTP flows I think the right folks on the thread and on the list are present to help make that choice. We just need to decide if that is something we want to specify.

I'm not sure what to say about this, as it looks like I need to set off a discussion (debate?) between you and my co-author, Paul Jones. Colin (from WGLC comments): Rather, within a single RTP session there are RTCP packets sent that give information about the RTP streams that are being sent, and that report on the reception quality of RTP streams being received. Using a single PHB and DSCP for all RTCP packets within an RTP session might make sense, but it's important to note that one role of RTCP is to provide an estimate of the round-trip time seen by the media, so the PHB\/DSCP will have to be chosen with care to avoid biasing that estimate too much. Paul (from shortly after the Toronto meeting: During the meeting, there was discussion of marking RTCP packets. Some notes I received on this topic suggested that it was proposed that RTCP should be marked the same as for RTP. The argument was that this is used for RTT calculations. If that is what was said, I'd like to state my disagreement. :-) The forward and reverse paths are not necessarily the same and there is nothing one should assume about the reverse path to provide guidance about the forward path (or vice versa). As perhaps a gross example, I have the ability to download far faster on my home Internet connection than I can upload. Other important traffic characteristics differ in each direction. Further, an RTCP packet might provide information related to several different RTP packets. I certainly would not want to see one RTCP packet per RTP packet. I'll watch where that discussion goes before proposing text. One of the uses of RTCP is certainly to estimate the round-trip time, as described in Section 6.4.1 (page 41) of RFC 3550. The DSCP marking used for RTCP does need to take this use into account. Ideally, this would mean RTCP packets were marked the same as the corresponding RTP packets, as I suggested in the meeting. However, Paul is correct that this only works when all RTP packets have the same marking. Accordingly, I’m not sure what the right marking is for RTCP. One approach might be to say that an SSRC that sends RTP packets with different marking should use marking with the highest(lowest?) precedence of those is uses for RTCP, so the RTT estimate calculated from RTCP is representative of some RTP packets. I’m not sure that using a single DSCP for all RTCP packets would achieve that. Can this working group reasonably answer this question?

This is the core of open issue [B] and resolving it is likely to resolve much of open issue [F]. I think we're just scratching at a deeper issue here: What is the role of the RTT estimate, and is RTT what we're looking for? In ack-based congestion control, RTT estimates are used to determine when we should say \"we have not seen the ACK we expected\" - which indicates either packet loss or increased congestion, either on the forward or the reverse path - the algorithm does not care which. The signal is only useful for end-of-packet-train packet loss (because otherwise there will be later packets leading to SACK indications of lost packets before the RTT timer runs out), so the exact value doesn't really matter - only that the false positive rate isn't too high. In delay-based, sender-side-only congestion control, however, RTT has to be used as a stand-in for the sender->receiver transit time (because we have nothing else). So any variation in return-path RTT is going to be interpreted as congestion change on the forward path - which means wrong decisions. My conclusions are two: - If delay-based senders-side-only is used, what matters is that the feedback signal gets there with as little delay variation as possible. The highest precedence available should be used. - Delay-based schemes need to have the timing done at receiver. RTT is just too sensitive to errors. The last argument belongs in RMCAT, not here. I'll leave the first argument for your consideration. I believe the key question is: Is the role of RTCP in providing RTCP estimates important enough to serve as the primary basis for providing guidance on DSCP usage w\/RTCP? Here's a summary of the \"yes it is\" viewpoint (from Colin Perkins): Using a single PHB and DSCP for all RTCP packets within an RTP session might make sense, but it's important to note that one role of RTCP is to provide an estimate of the round-trip time seen by the media, so the PHB\/DSCP will have to be chosen with care to avoid biasing that estimate too much.

Diffserv is based on network nodes applying different forwarding treatments to packets whose IP headers are marked with different Diffserv Codepoints (DSCPs). WebRTC applications, as well as some conferencing applications, have begun using the Session Description Protocol (SDP) bundle negotiation mechanism to send multiple traffic streams with different QoS requirements using the same network 5-tuple. The results of using multiple DSCPs to obtain different QoS treatments within a single network 5-tuple have transport protocol interactions, particularly with congestion control functionality (e.g., reordering). In addition, DSCP markings may be changed or removed between the traffic source and destination.

The former, quoting from Section 2.4 of the draft: In addition, remarking may remove application-level distinctions in forwarding behavior - e.g., if multiple PHBs within an AF class are used to distinguish different types of frames within a video flow, token-bucket-based remarkers operating in Color-Blind mode (see [RFC2697] and [RFC2698] for examples) may remark solely based on flow rate and burst behavior, removing the drop precedence distinctions specified by the source. So, from a DSCP perspective, there won't be a problem mixing traffic needing different DSCP in the same 5-tuple. Beyond that, if the network that the traffic is entering does not support the AF class involved on that ingress, DSCP remarking to zero (best effort) is a likely behavior. Sure. Only fix there is to restore the DSCP by some other sort of signaling. Which means separate 5-tuples (to make such signaling straight forward) or requiring network gear to peek deeper into the packets to restore the DSCP bits, such as distinguish STUN\/DTLS\/RTP packets from each other, and if RTP to use the solution-de-jour for how to identify more-important RTP packets from less-important RTP packets (such as RTP header extension which has been bantered about, or DPI).

Is the problem lack of color awareness in the AF remarker, or that AF remarkers assume all packets in the 5-tuple have the same color? -d Thanks, --David -----Original Message----- From: Dan Wing [mailto:dwing@cisco.com] Sent: Wednesday, June 11, 2014 8:32 PM To: Brian E Carpenter Cc: Black, David; dart@ietf.org Subject: Re: [Dart] RTP and non-RTP traffic on same UDP 5-tuple On Jun 11, 2014, at 1:42 PM, Brian E Carpenter <brian.e.carpenter@gmail.com> wrote: In another message, Ruediger Geib asked (>), and I responded: -------------------- Is the following correct: UDP_5-tuple-+--transport protocol 1----- | +--RTP session 1----- | +--RTP session 2-----+---RTP_stream_2.1 | +---RTP_stream_2.2 |...

The author team for draft-york would like input on whether the draft should discuss mixing of RTP and non-RTP traffic on the same UDP 5-tuple, vs. using separate 5-tuples (probably separate UDP ports) for RTP and non-RTP traffic. One observation is that we should be thinking about a 6-tuple these days (see RFC 6437). I don't think it makes much difference to the argument. Another observation is when load balancing is in play, things get a bit more complicated, but to a first approximation using the same 5-tuple or 6-tuple will usually ensure that all the packets reach the same load-balanced destination, which is probably a good thing. Third, reverting to the diffserv discussion, the same 5-tuple should ensure that all the packets would be classified the same (if they cross a diffserv domain boundary and get reclassified). What do you mean by 'all the packets would be classified the same'? If you mean all the packets in a 5-tuple would get the same differentiated treatment, that is not desirable, because there are lots of folks wanting to send video i-frames or packets with FEC or other stuff with lower drop precedence than other packets. -d Brian RTCWEB clearly intends to mix SCTP (via DTLS) and RTP traffic on the same 5-tuple see the last paragraph of Section 3.5 of draft-ietf-rtcweb- transports-04: RTCWEB implementations MUST support multiplexing of DTLS and RTP over the same port pair, as described in the DTLS_SRTP specification [RFC5764], section 5.1.2.

Please comment, including whether mixing SCTP and RTP on the same UDP 5-tuple is a good idea (some rationale for doing this sort of multiplexing onto a single 5-tuple can be found in Section 3 of draft-york-dart-dscp- rtp-00).

{"_id":"doc-en-dart-E0PsU9zyly41Uwg56pbJzr559Lk","title":"","text":"[Dart] Commentary on draft-york-00\nThis message contains running notes made during my initial review of draft-york-dart-dscp-rtp-00. Apologies for lack of organization; it seems better to get them out soon than to polish them. 2 Background \"any one or more modalities\" -> \"one or more modalities\" would read better. \"RTP defines the mechanism by which real-time data is transmitted\" seems like an overreach. \"RTP defines a common encapsulation format and handling rules for real-time data transmitted over the Internet\" would be more appropriate. \"With most applications, a single...\" - this is true for legacy. It seems likely not to remain true. The definition of \"media flow\" needs to be in a \"definitions\" section. It's too important to be hiding in the \"background\" section - see much other mail. \"SCTP ... can be multiplexed with one or more RTP sessions\". Actually we can only multiplex SCTP with a single RTP session. There have been proposals that would allow multiplexing of multiple RTP sessions (each containing multiple media flows) over a single 5-tuple, but these were not accepted. The mention of MediaStream should be removed from bullet 1. It just confuses. In bullet 2, only one RTP session can be multiplexed with another transport protocol (again). The last paragraph is where distinguishing between <some kind of media related name> and <RTP packet flow> is very desirable. As it stands now, it seems simple, but when you start asking what all these flows \"are\", more precisely, it gets very confusing. 2.1 DiffServ bullet 1, first list: grammar nit - \"classify traffic and setting bits\" -> \"classify traffic and set bits\" \"In this context, \"forwarding behavior\" is a general - for example\" .... is a general what, exactly? \"to allocates resources\" -> \"to allocate resources\" Nit: the all-zero DSCP seems to have only five zeroes. 2.2 Diffserv PHBs do you want to mention what the difference between the 4 AF classes is? Is it just isolation, or is there a ranking between them (in theory or in practice)? 2.3 Diffserv and transport protocols The last paragraph is true but irrelevant - we're not using UDP here, we're using other protocols carried inside UDP. And the stuff that's carried inside UDP may be sensitive to reordering or may be insensitive to reordering - we just can't tell purely from the fact that it's UDP. Suggest deleting the paragraph. IMPORTANT: There is a huge missing section here - which is about sensitivity of real time communications to packet reordering. I'm not sure how much can be said here, but I think this is quite complex: - Packet reordering may lead to spurious NACK generation and unneeded retransmission, just as for the data flow case. How sensitive it is to that depends on timers. - Packet reordering that can be accomodated within an existing jitter buffer will not lead to any quality issues. - Packet reordering that causes jitter buffers to extend is bad news for delay sensitive communication, such as interactive conversations. Interactive implementations may choose to discard late data - but this is a matter of meeting the deadline, not a matter of whether it's reordered. For replay of recorded media, it doesn't matter much. - Packet loss is dealt with differently on interactive media than on reliable data delivery: Instead of retransmissing all lost data, one finds a reference point that new data can be based on, and continues to transmit media relative to that. One does not attempt to recover lost frames that are history. How that affects this discussion ... I'm not too sure. 2.4 DSCP remarking The discussion of token-bucket-based remarkers leaves me a bit confused. To me, it's obvious (?) that token-bucket-based remarkers would operate in color-blind mode on a network boundary, and in color-sensitive mode only when they had assurance that incoming markings were already indicating color. Thus, flows from an end-user system should only hit color-blind remarkers; the real question is: will a color-blind remarker use the incoming DSCP codepoint to decide which of a group of remarking treatments it chooses for the packets? It seems to me that the section should tell me, and it doesn't. 3 RTP Multiplexing Background Repeating the story about \"only one RTP session per 5-tuple, please\".... 4 Recommendations As discussed above, the first SHOULD NOT (reordering within a media flow) is not sufficiently founded in discussion of media properties. Reordering may be a problem, or it may not be a problem. I don't see any issues with the other recommendations (the second seems like an obvious thing to say, for well documented reasons; the three others seem like no-ops from a practical standpoint). Thanks for getting this out the door!"}

The IESG contact persons are Richard Barnes and Alissa Cooper. A URL of this Internet Draft is: http:\/\/datatracker.ietf.org\/doc\/draft-ietf-dart-dscp-rtp\/ Technical Summary This document describes the interaction between Differentiated Services (DiffServ) network quality of service (QoS) functionality and real-time network communication, including communication based on the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). DiffServ is based on network nodes applying different forwarding treatments to packets whose IP headers are marked with different DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs). WebRTC applications, as well as some conferencing applications, have begun using the Session Description Protocol (SDP) bundle negotiation mechanism to send multiple traffic streams with different QoS requirements using the same network 5-tuple. Use of different DSCPs to obtain different QoS treatments within a single network 5-tuple, the results (e.g., reordering) may cause transport protocol interactions, particularly with congestion control functionality. In addition, DSCP markings may be changed or removed between the traffic source and destination. This document covers the implications of these DiffServ aspects for real-time network communication, including WebRTC. Working Group Summary The DART working group was formed in April of 2014. The working group was chartered to focus on a constrained problem and conclude quickly. DART adopted this document with very little controversy. While the working group is nominally in the RAI area, it has been effectively a cross-area effort between RAI and TSV. This document resulted in lively discussion among a core group of experts from both areas. In general, the discussion converged quickly, and there were no unresolved controversies. In the shepherd's opinion, the only impediment to consensus was that discussion kept overturning rocks, forcing participants to think about new issues. One notable issue was whether this draft should offer guidance on the interaction between having multiple DSCPs in a stream and the multiple stream optimization work (draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-multi-stream-optimisation.) The working group chose to avoid such guidance in this draft, and leave that for the multi-stream draft to solve. Document Quality During the working group last call, we solicited comments from RTCWEB, AVTCORE, MMUSIC, CLUE, TSVWG, and RMCAT. In the shepherd's opinion, it has been well reviewed, and represents a strong consensus. The shepherd does not think it needs any further specific reviews, other than the usual reviews it would receive during the IETF last call process (for example, Gen-ART and SecDir). Since the document does not specify protocol, it will not be directly implemented. However, we expect that at least the RTCWEB working group will incorporate guidance from this document into it's output. Personnel The Document Shepherd is Ben Campbell. The Responsible AD is Richard Barnes."}

If such a constraint is not desired then the text may say \"if mapped to a non-EF PHB, excess traffic may be shaped\". I'd like to ask for some explaining text if shaping of EF excess traffic is regarded as a property to be expected for this PHB. If an AF class is used to transport EF, then any potential remarking should be done in a way avoiding re-ordering (i.e. remark to DSCPs within the same AF class only). There's no point in remarking excess EF traffic to a PHB which may cause reordering.

August 2014 22:13 An: Geib, Rüdiger Cc: david.black@emc.com; dart@ietf.org; tsvwg@ietf.org Betreff: Re: [Dart] WGLC: draft-ietf-dart-dscp-rtp-02 Hi Ruediger, Hi David, new EF related text has been added in the -01 version. I've copied in some text of RFC3246 related to EF remarking and policing below. My take: . remarking of entire flows is an option, but no remarking of packets exceeding EF capacity limits. - looking at the EF jitter and delay properties, I doubt that shaping is desirable. RFC3246 doesn't mention shaping as part of EF conditioning. I personally wouldn't expect EF shaping in sections where policing is applied. - dropping of packets exceeding EF capacity is a MUST, if I interpret RFC3246 correctly. Well, it seems to me to be a SHOULD, with the MUST that you cite below being conditional on \"a mechanism that allows unlimited preemption of other traffic.\" So I would not be at all surprised by deployments that support shaping and remarking. Also, there are certainly implementations that are closer to RFC 2598 or RFC 3248 and therefore less strict. I think the draft should make it clear that there is likely to be variation in actual behaviour for EF traffic that exceeds the nominal rate. (Leaving aside the fact that without a string of matching SLAs along the path, the nominal rate might not even be well defined.) Brian I suggest to adapt the section of draft-dart-dscp to be more precise regarding the optional remarking of EF traffic and to remove shaping as a conditioning option if traffic is beyond the EF forwarding capacity limit. A Proposal for the final sentence: ...exceeds that capacity must be dropped. EF compliant flows may be remarked to a different DSCP. All other new text indicated by the Diff version looks allright. Regards, Ruediger draft-dart-dscp: 3. Expedited Forwarding (EF) [RFC3246] intended for inelastic traffic. Beyond the basic EF PHB, the VOICE-ADMIT PHB [RFC5865] is an admission controlled variant of the EF PHB. Both of these PHBs are based on pre-configured limited forwarding capacity; traffic that exceeds that capacity may be shaped, remarked to a different DSCP, or dropped. ######################################## RFC3246 (three excerpts): Packets belonging to a single microflow within the EF aggregate passing through a device SHOULD NOT experience re-ordering in normal operation of the device. Packets marked for EF PHB MAY be remarked at a DS domain boundary only to other codepoints that satisfy the EF PHB. Packets marked for EF PHBs SHOULD NOT be demoted or promoted to another PHB by a DS domain. If the EF PHB is implemented by a mechanism that allows unlimited preemption of other traffic (e.g., a priority queue), the implementation MUST include some means to limit the damage EF traffic could inflict on other traffic (e.g., a token bucket rate limiter). Traffic that exceeds this limit MUST be discarded. -----Ursprüngliche Nachricht----- Von: Dart [mailto:dart-bounces@ietf.org] Im Auftrag von Ben Campbell Gesendet: Samstag, 9.

The text: This guidance may result in different DSCP markings for RTP streams and RTCP receiver reports about those RTP streams. The resulting variation in network QoS treatment by traffic direction could result in unrepresentative round trip time (RTT) estimates that don't correspond to consistent network QoS treatment in both directions. RTCP receiver reports may be relatively infrequent (e.g., may be sent only once per video frame rendered) and hence the resulting RTT estimates are of limited utility for congestion control (although they have other important uses, see [RFC3550]). For this reason, it is not important that RTCP receiver reports receive the same network QoS treatment as the RTP stream or streams being reported on. suggests that the RTT estimate derived from RTCP will be unrepresentative, since it may not have consistent network QoS in each direction. However, since the RTP media packets can use different QoS in each direction, the RTCP also needs to do so, to be representative! If the media used different QoS markings for different directions and the RTCP used the same marking, the RTT estimate wouldn’t match that of the media. I suggest the paragraph be changed to: This guidance may result in different DSCP markings for RTP streams and the RTCP packets reporting on those RTP streams. The resulting variation in network QoS treatment by traffic direction is necessary to get representative round trip time (RTT) estimates that correspond to the media path RTT. RTCP receiver reports may be relatively infrequent and hence the resulting RTT estimates are of limited utility for congestion control (although they have other important uses, see [RFC3550]). For this reason, it is important that RTCP receiver reports sent by an SSRC receive the same network QoS treatment as the RTP stream being sent by that SSRC.

Whether I use the same DSCP for all RTCP reports I send is, I think, orthogonal to whether I use the multi-stream-optimisation. The dart draft should possibly say that, but I'm not sure that's the sentence we have above. I read the sentence above as saying flatly and unconditionally \"don't use multi-stream-optimization when the RTP streams have different PHBs\" - which means that if I want to use one PHB for audio and another PHB for video, I can't use multi-stream-optimization. I'd be sad if that was the case, *especially* if we can't figure out any reason to make that recommendation. _______________________________________________ Dart mailing list Dart@ietf.org https:\/\/www.ietf.org\/mailman\/listinfo\/dart -- Colin Perkins http:\/\/csperkins.org\/"}

Speaking only for myself, I don't think so, because there are two different concepts involved - IMHO, this draft needs two terms to refer to: a) What the application sends. b) How RTP carries that traffic. \"RTP packet stream\" is clearly the right RTP term for the latter, and the draft was written that way. I would've liked to have used \"media stream\" for the former, but W3C has defined MediaStream to not be a single stream of media (go figure ...). \"media flow\" seemed to be as good a term as any for that concept, and \"media flow\" is already used for that concept in draft-ietf-tsvwg-rtcweb-qos (i.e., it was not invented for this draft). Yes - except that every time it's used in draft-york, including in the place it is defined, it means \"RTP packet stream\". If you are trying to use it for the stuff that's inside the RTP packets instead of the RTP packet streams, the definition needs to say so. \"Media source\" is the term I think you're thinking of in -taxonomy- that corresponds more closely to the term - the complexifier is all the cases where a single media source is carried over multiple packet streams.

Great - thanks for taking a look. If a MediaStream is carried in a RTP session, the text may also explicitely say that (it says MediaStreamTrack == media flow, which is carried in an individual RTP packet stream) As I read Section 11 of draft-ietf-rtcweb-rtp-usage-15, for RTCWEB, that would happen only when the MediaStream contains exactly one MediaStreamTrack. The use of these terms in bullet item 1 in section 2 is intended to be specific to RTCWEB, but we could add text elsewhere to point out that non-RTCWEB usage of MediaStreams could use an RTP packet stream for each Media Stream, independent of how many MediaStreamTracks each MediaStream contains. Could you suggest a reference that could be cited for usage of an RTP packet stream for each MediaStream independent of how many MediaStreamTracks each MediaStream contains? Careful - \"RTP packet stream\" is one of those concepts that can be meaningless without citing a specific definition. draft-ietf-avtext-rtp-grouping-taxonomy is probably the best reference at the moment. It says this about \"Packet stream\": 2.1.10. Packet Stream A stream of RTP packets containing media data, source or redundant. The Packet Stream is identified by an SSRC belonging to a particular RTP session. The RTP session is identified as discussed in Section 2.2.2. Under this definition, it's impossible to put more than one MediaStreamTrack into a packet stream. In a lot of cases (FEC, redundancy, SVC, simulcast), there will be multiple RTP packet streams associated with one MediaStreamTrack. The term is used only once in the draft, but unfortunately defines a new term to mean the same thing: The most common protocol used for real time media is the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP)[RFC3550]. RTP defines the mechanism by which real-time data is transmitted between hosts on the Internet. With most applications, a single media type (e.g., audio) is transmitted within a single RTP session. However, it is possible to transmit multiple, distinct media flows over the same RTP session as individual RTP packet streams. This is referred to as RTP multiplexing. For the purposes of this draft, the term \"media flow\" refers to a sequence of packets that is transmitted as a single RTP packet stream. The term \"media flow\" doesn't sound to me like a good term to use for this concept. Would the authors be willing to consider switching to \"packet stream\"? _______________________________________________ Dart mailing list Dart@ietf.org https:\/\/www.ietf.org\/mailman\/listinfo\/dart _______________________________________________ Dart mailing list Dart@ietf.org https:\/\/www.ietf.org\/mailman\/listinfo\/dart"}

This draft is a work item of the DiffServ Applied to Real-time Transports Working Group of the IETF. Title : Differentiated Services (DiffServ) and Real-time Communication Authors : David Black Paul Jones Filename : draft-ietf-dart-dscp-rtp-07.txt Pages : 26 Date : 2014-09-24 Abstract: This memo describes the interaction between Differentiated Services (DiffServ) network quality of service (QoS) functionality and real- time network communication, including communication based on the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). DiffServ is based on network nodes applying different forwarding treatments to packets whose IP headers are marked with different DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs). WebRTC applications, as well as some conferencing applications, have begun using the Session Description Protocol (SDP) bundle negotiation mechanism to send multiple traffic streams with different QoS requirements using the same network 5-tuple. The results of using multiple DSCPs to obtain different QoS treatments within a single network 5-tuple (e.g., reordering) have transport protocol interactions, particularly with congestion control functionality. In addition, DSCP markings may be changed or removed between the traffic source and destination. This memo covers the implications of these DiffServ aspects for real-time network communication, including WebRTC. The IETF datatracker status page for this draft is: https:\/\/datatracker.ietf.org\/doc\/draft-ietf-dart-dscp-rtp\/ There's also a htmlized version available at: http:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/draft-ietf-dart-dscp-rtp-07 A diff from the previous version is available at: http:\/\/www.ietf.org\/rfcdiff?url2=draft-ietf-dart-dscp-rtp-07 Please note that it may take a couple of minutes from the time of submission until the htmlized version and diff are available at tools.ietf.org.

If different DSCP marks result in different routing or the uses of different queues and therefore competing with different and potentially changing data flows ambient in the network, one would expect any such interactions to be exaggerated; for example, if multi-topology routing is used and some data flows take wildly different routes than others, one could readily imagine a packet in each data flow sent simultaneously arriving spaced tens or hundreds of milliseconds apart. While it is not referenced in the document, the term \"real-time\" as used here is defined in RFC 1633, and refers to an application that requires that the network make specific guarantees to it, whether in end to end delay, minimum delivery rate, or both. The term is generally understood to refer to voice and video services, but can also refer to telemetry or other traffic loads. My initial inclination is to pick up (in edited form) the text on the meaning of the term \"real-time\", including its reference to RFC 1633. Thoughts?

The action of changing the existing protocols is implied rather than explicit in the current wording. \"current designs\" is vague.

Indeed, that sentence is problematic. I've edited the entire paragraph for clarity. Here's the new text: When PHBs that enable reordering are mixed within a single network 5-tuple, the effect is to mix QoS-based traffic classes within the scope of a single transport protocol connection or association. As these QoS-based traffic classes receive different network QoS treatments, they use different pools of network resources and hence may exhibit different levels of congestion. The result for congestion-controlled protocols is that a separate instance of congestion control functionality is needed per QoS-based traffic class. Current transport protocols support only a single instance of congestion control functionality for an entire connection or association; extending that support to multiple instances would add significant protocol complexity. Traffic in different QoS-based classes may use different paths through the network; this complicates path integrity checking in connection- or association-based protocols, as those paths may fail independently. That's great. Thanks!

[Karen] Ok - \"certainly not viable\" is too strong formulation. Having different drop precedences within the same SCTP CC context would, given that SCTP CC presently is drop driven only, results in that the whole data channel is impacted, from a CC perspective, by the highest drop precedence. But I realize that whether this is acceptable is a question indeed. I think you're on to something here. If the drop precedences only came into play after the decision to drop a packet had been made, their effect would probably be minimal, as they would only affect what to drop in a session, not how much to drop. OTOH, DiffServ AF is not intended to operate in that fashion - the rationale for the 3 drop precedences per AF class was based on envisioning the output of two-threshold rate shaper: AFx1 - Within base or committed traffic profile AFx2 - Beyond base\/committed, but within excess or burst traffic profile AFx3 - Completely out of profile Hence the relative mix of those drop precedences can be expected to affect the overall drop rate\/probability seen in a session where those precedences are mixed.

Or more generally relate to the fact that media streams within the same congestion control context cannot be handled individually. Right now such considerations are not in the document. If the intention is for such consideration to come in documents from the dart wg, then it would be very important to have a reference to this dependency - or ? IMHO, such a reference is necessary, although the dart WG draft will be informational. The reference should be added once there is an official dart WG draft (likely to happen this week). Something else: Right now the document stipulates that packets within the same media stream may be marked with different DSCP codepoints, i.e., it is said: One may select difference drop precedences for the different packets in the media flow. Therefore, all packets in the stream SHOULD be marked with the same priority but can have difference drop precedences. which indeed is in compliance with the recommendations put forward in draft-york-dart-dscp-rtp-00 in that it ensures that the DSCP markings do not result in re-ordering within the media flow, but has it been ascertained, from a CC perspective that usage of different drop precedence within the same CC context is viable ? Good question - I will include that in my slides for the dart WG meeting. From the RTCWEB data channel perspective this certainly isn't viable (being SCTP based), whether it is viable from an RMCAT CC perspective is something that we in the RMCAT wg would need to make more clear. What's the rationale for \"certainly isn't viable\" regarding different drop precedences within a single SCTP session? [Karen] Ok - \"certainly not viable\" is too strong formulation. Having different drop precedences within the same SCTP CC context would, given that SCTP CC presently is drop driven only, results in that the whole data channel is impacted, from a CC perspective, by the highest drop precedence. But I realize that whether this is acceptable is a question indeed.

DiffServ is based on network nodes applying different forwarding treatments to packets whose IP headers are marked with different DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs). WebRTC applications, as well as some conferencing applications, have begun using the Session Description Protocol (SDP) bundle negotiation mechanism to send multiple traffic streams with different QoS requirements using the same network 5-tuple. Use of different DSCPs to obtain different QoS treatments within a single network 5-tuple, the results (e.g., reordering) may cause transport protocol interactions, particularly with congestion control functionality. In addition, DSCP markings may be changed or removed between the traffic source and destination.

I was, but thinking again, I'm not so sure. I think this recommendation is wrong. I can't find anything in your latest messages that speak to this particular point. You're one of the authors of -multi-stream, so you should be able to speak clearly to the point. Can you clarify? If I have several SSRCs, and receive several media streams, then provided each of my SSRCs sees the exact same quality for each received stream, then I can use the multi-stream-optimisation to reduce the number of RTCP cross reports I send. The multi-stream-optimisation draft says that already, and it's not clear that the DART drafts needs to say anything further on the topic. Whether I use the same DSCP for all RTCP reports I send is, I think, orthogonal to whether I use the multi-stream-optimisation. The dart draft should possibly say that, but I'm not sure that's the sentence we have above. I read the sentence above as saying flatly and unconditionally \"don't use multi-stream-optimization when the RTP streams have different PHBs\" - which means that if I want to use one PHB for audio and another PHB for video, I can't use multi-stream-optimization.

There is another little point though. We've been discussing port numbers as though they are transport-independent. Actually, a classifier needs to look at the protocol number (TCP, UDP, SCTP, DCCP etc) before it knows for sure where the port numbers are. So debating this point before draft-ietf-rtcweb-transports-05 is rock solid may be a little academic. I don't think generic classifiers are set up for \"SCTP over DTLS over ICE\" for example. As far as anything at all in RTCWEB is rock solid, the decision to use UDP is rock solid. So we can take that as a given for RTCWEB. (apart from the case where one uses TCP because the firewalls don't allow UDP...) Ah. Now I understand better. The following comment is out of scope for DART, but I think that draft-ietf-rtcweb-transports desparately needs an overview section with a diagram that shows the complete set of transport nestings. I was very confused by http:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/draft-ietf-rtcweb-transports-05#section-3.5 and such a diagram would make it much clearer what a diffserv classifier would see in the outermost header. Generic classifiers will detect the traffic as UDP, and may be able to tell RTP from DTLS-encapsulated data in the same way as the DTLS\/RTP demultiplexing does it. I expect David will agree that RFC 2983 might be worth a read, because some of the same issues arise. I guess that if RTCweb takes over the universe, classifiers might be updated to understand RTCweb transport nestings, but initially you certainly can't assume that. Brian"}

My assumption has always been that the default classifier will simply re-mark packets with the default DSCP. We also have \"A DS ingress node is responsible for ensuring that the traffic entering the DS domain conforms to any TCA between it and the other domain to which the ingress node is connected.\" and the definition of a TCA: \" Traffic Conditioning an agreement specifying classifier rules Agreement (TCA) and any corresponding traffic profiles and metering, marking, discarding and\/or shaping rules which are to apply to the traffic streams selected by the classifier. A TCA encompasses all of the traffic conditioning rules explicitly specified within a SLA along with all of the rules implicit from the relevant service requirements and\/or from a DS domain's service provisioning policy.\" In other words: the treatment of unrecognized DSCPs needs to be stated in the TCA part of the SLA.

In draft-ietf-avtcore-multiplex-guidelines, it goes to great length to explain that multiplexing is on the SSRC. It also says no two media sources shall use the same PT value. No, it does not say that - in fact, it says exactly the opposite. It says that it cannot use the same SSRC for two different media streams and depend on PT to distinguish between them. PT is not a multiplexing point. The PT value is a single byte, and is sometimes used for other purposes (with RTP\/RTCP multiplexing, for example, some numbers are unusable because RTCP uses the same field for operation codes). Trying to use it to distinguish between streams would reduce the max number of possible streams to a seriously ridiculously low number. Can you point me at the language you interpreted that way? If it can be read that way, it *must* be changed. Thus, a payload type could be used when demultiplexing, though the text says otherwise. Perhaps this language exists to support multipoint? Thus, a receiver first looks at the SSRC to identify the source, then the PT to determine what the packet contains? Is SSRC demuxing there only for multipoint? No. The PT tells the receiver what format the packet contains. The SSRC tells you which RTP packet flow it belongs to. In some cases one RTP packet flow will switch between different payload types (audio, DTMF and comfort noise being the most common examples), while still representing only one media flow. Why not allow the PT number space to be distinct per SSRC? I have problems parsing this question into the context above. What are you asking?

There have been proposals that would allow multiplexing of multiple RTP sessions (each containing multiple media flows) over a single 5-tuple, but these were not accepted. Your draft (draft-ietf-rtcweb-transports) says: RTCWEB implementations MUST support multiplexing of DTLS and RTP over the same port pair, as described in the DTLS_SRTP specification [RFC5764], section 5.1.2. A! ll application layer protocol payloads over this DTLS connection are SCTP packets. I had a question about this as we discussed the DART draft. I assumed the only DTLS connection would be one used for key negotiation for SRTP. Is that not the case? Would there be multiple DTLS connections multiplexed? If so, how would one be differentiated from another? EKR is the expert here. As I understand it, the key material for DTLS-SRTP is derived from the session keys from the DTLS session. This does not in any way affect the usage of the same DTLS session for passing DTLS data. As for RTP Session multiplexing, it's interesting to hear that proposals are dead. Is there a proposal for multiplexing different media types (e.g., audio and video) within the sa! me RTP Session, then?

Jones wrote: Harald, Thanks for the clarification. If you'll indulge, allow me to ask one more basic question... In draft-ietf-avtcore-multiplex-guidelines, it goes to great length to explain that multiplexing is on the SSRC. It also says no two media sources shall use the same PT value. No, it does not say that - in fact, it says exactly the opposite. It says that it cannot use the same SSRC for two different media streams and depend on PT to distinguish between them. PT is not a multiplexing point. The PT value is a single byte, and is sometimes used for other purposes (with RTP\/RTCP multiplexing, for example, some numbers are unusable because RTCP uses the same field for operation codes). Trying to use it to distinguish between streams would reduce the max number of possible streams to a seriously ridiculously low number. Can you point me at the language you interpreted that way? If it can be read that way, it *must* be changed. Thus, a payload type could be used when demultiplexing, though the text says otherwise. Perhaps this language exists to support multipoint? Thus, a receiver first looks at the SSRC to identify the source, then the PT to determine what the packet contains? Is SSRC demuxing there only for multipoint? No. The PT tells the receiver what format the packet contains. The SSRC tells you which RTP packet flow it belongs to. In some cases one RTP packet flow will switch between different payload types (audio, DTMF and comfort noise being the most common examples), while still representing only one media flow. Why not allow the PT number space to be distinct per SSRC? I have problems parsing this question into the context above. What are you asking?

Actually we can only multiplex SCTP with a single RTP session. There have been proposals that would allow multiplexing of multiple RTP sessions (each containing multiple media flows) over a single 5-tuple, but these were not accepted. Your draft (draft-ietf-rtcweb-transports) says: RTCWEB implementations MUST support multiplexing of DTLS and RTP over the same port pair, as described in the DTLS_SRTP specification [RFC5764], section 5.1.2. A! ll application layer protocol payloads over this DTLS connection are SCTP packets. I had a question about this as we discussed the DART draft. I assumed the only DTLS connection would be one used for key negotiation for SRTP. Is that not the case? Would there be multiple DTLS connections multiplexed? If so, how would one be differentiated from another? EKR is the expert here. As I understand it, the key material for DTLS-SRTP is derived from the session keys from the DTLS session. This does not in any way affect the usage of the same DTLS session for passing DTLS data. As for RTP Session multiplexing, it's interesting to hear that proposals are dead.

Full AF support should classify all 3 PHBs that make up an AF class into a single aggregate on the node, with remarking applied to that aggregate, not DSCP by DSCP. If end-to-end DiffServ PHBs are what you look for, standardize what is really required and be clear on how to use it. As noted earlier, that's not the goal of the dart WG, as I understand it.

This makes sense from an economical point of view, but limits deployments to the minimum common denominator. - to configure a PHB, there are classifiers, policers, schedulers, AQM and re-markers. Implementations differ to some aspects (e.g. on supported number of classes and ingress\/egress remarking). Limits like less than 20 PHBs may apply today. I'd be interested, whether there are offers of any complete AF class as part of a single product. - there used to be a possibility to ignore the lower DSCP bits 3-6, but there's no standard to that.

I never saw any of these philosophies remotely resembling the other. PHBs or classes are used to identify products, access types, stream types and so on. These usually just consume PHBs with sometimes at best loose relation to standards. If end-to-end DiffServ PHBs are what you look for, standardise what is really required and be clear on how to use it. If a network provider is expected to support these PHBs, there must be a convincing reason to do so. Take EF as an example for a well specified DiffServ standard.

I'm not sure about the \"obvious\" point - anyone care to comment on what's actually deployed\/configured in practice? The answer to the final question about choice of remarking treatment is \"yes\" although the PHBs in an AF class should receive the same treatment.

So, from a DSCP perspective, there won't be a problem mixing traffic needing different DSCP in the same 5-tuple. Beyond that, if the network that the traffic is entering does not support the AF class involved on that ingress, DSCP remarking to zero (best effort) is a likely behavior. Sure. Only fix there is to restore the DSCP by some other sort of signaling. Which means separate 5-tuples (to make such signaling straight forward) or requiring network gear to peek deeper into the packets to restore the DSCP bits, such as distinguish STUN\/DTLS\/RTP packets from each other, and if RTP to use the solution-de-jour for how to identify more-important RTP packets from less-important RTP packets (such as RTP header extension which has been bantered about, or DPI). Hoping DSCP is preserved or re-written without semantic loss seems a long-dead pipe dream.

Another observation is when load balancing is in play, things get a bit more complicated, but to a first approximation using the same 5-tuple or 6-tuple will usually ensure that all the packets reach the same load-balanced destination, which is probably a good thing.

The argument to send RTCP packets in the most expedient way sounds reasonable. I don't know if we need to recommend a particular DSCP, since we already have quite a bit of text on how DSCPs might (or might not) map into some predictable PHB treatment. Good question and valid point. Nowhere in the document do we recommend the use of a particular DSCP value for any particular thing, and we should not recommend a particular value for RTCP in this document. I'm just not sure what statements should be made. I suspect we can all agree that RTCP information is important. It's just the DSCP-related guidance that goes with that that is challenging. I don’t agree that RTCP information should be sent as higher priority than the media. Ideally, it should be sent with the same priority as the media, so it can be used to sample the RTT. This RTT sample is independent of RMCAT. It’s in base RTP specification, and so is something we need to support to the extent possible. Since not all the media sent by a single SSRC has the same marking, my suggestion would be that each SSRC mark the RTCP packets it sends with one of the same code points as it uses to mark the media. Since RTCP is somewhat important, it would make sense for each SSRC to mark the RTCP packets it sends using the highest priority code point it uses to mark the RTP media packets it sends. That makes sense to me. Paul, and others, do you agree with that last paragraph? I agree that the value should be one of the values used for media, but the challenge is specifying which DSCP value to use. If audio is sent using EF, video as AF41, app sharing video as AF31, etc., which of these does the endpoint choose to use for RTCP? Such an endpoint will have three SSRC values, and will mark the RTCP packets sent by each SSRC in the same way as the media packets sent by that SSRC. That is, the RTCP relating to the audio will be marked EF, the RTCP relating to the video will be marked AF41, and the RTCP relating to the application sharing video will be marked AF31. The RTCP packets for each stream are sent separately, so this case seems straight-forward. I'm a little confused here. These are separate SSRCs, but all part of a single RTP session. So, wouldn’t the three SSRCs be reported in different report blocks in the sender report? Each of the SSRCs will report on all the others, unless the rtp-multi-stream-optimisation draft is used, but so what? The more difficult case is when an SSRC is sending video using different markings for RTP packets carrying the I- and P-frames. Should that SSRC then mark its RTCP packets like the RTP packets carrying I-frames, like the RTP packets carrying P-frames, or what? For this, I would argue it should be whatever DSCP that has the lower drop precedence (in the case of assured forwarding). Otherwise, it should be the same as the media, I'd think. You mean the RTCP for each SSRC should use the DSCP with the lowest drop preference of those used for the media sent by that SSRC? -- Colin Perkins http:\/\/csperkins.org\/"}

If you mean all the packets in a 5-tuple would get the same differentiated treatment, that is not desirable, because there are lots of folks wanting to send video i-frames or packets with FEC or other stuff with lower drop precedence than other packets. Dan, if a packet crosses a diffserv domain boundary, the assumption is that (absent a specific SLA) its DSCP *will* be rewritten in whatever way the classifier of the receiving domain desires. DSCPs don't have end to end semantics, unless there is a string of SLAs along the path that all provide the same DSCP semantics. Not everybody likes this, but it was what the operators in the diffserv WG wanted at the time. If all operators agree to implement a common subset of the DSCPs suggested in various TSVWG documents, there would be a de facto end to end SLA for those DSCPs. But today, that's a bit of a dream world. So, for two arbitrary RTCweb users, there's certainly no assurance that the DSCP set at the source will be preserved until the destination. On the contrary, it's quite likely to be set to zero (at the boundary of an operator that distrusts the DSCP field) or to a value deemed suitable by an ingress classifier for whatever 5-tuple it carries. It seems unlikely that a classifier will look further into the payload than the port numbers. I think I understand your meaning, but just to be sure: Even if the packets with the same 5-tuple have different DSCPs, the are likely to get reset to the same DSCP (probably zero) I'm not sure about \"probably\" (unless someone has done large-scale experiments, we don't really know) but it is the fail-safe default, so we can definitely say \"quite likely.\" at a boundary, because the classifier either ignores or distrusts the original markings entirely? (As opposed to remapping any given DSCP to a different DSCP, but maintaining some distinction within the flow.) Subject to David's comment about AF \"colour\" possibly being preserved, yes. There is another little point though. We've been discussing port numbers as though they are transport-independent. Actually, a classifier needs to look at the protocol number (TCP, UDP, SCTP, DCCP etc) before it knows for sure where the port numbers are. So debating this point before draft-ietf-rtcweb-transports-05 is rock solid may be a little academic. I don't think generic classifiers are set up for \"SCTP over DTLS over ICE\" for example. Brian"}

However, if the app sharing video is considered more important by some applications, perhaps that's the value that should be used in those applications. I can accept the suggestion, leaving the specific selection as an implementation matter.

If audio is sent using EF, video as AF41, app sharing video as AF31, etc., which of these does the endpoint choose to use for RTCP? Such an endpoint will have three SSRC values, and will mark the RTCP packets sent by each SSRC in the same way as the media packets sent by that SSRC. That is, the RTCP relating to the audio will be marked EF, the RTCP relating to the video will be marked AF41, and the RTCP relating to the application sharing video will be marked AF31. The RTCP packets for each stream are sent separately, so this case seems straight-forward. I'm a little confused here. These are separate SSRCs, but all part of a single RTP session. So, wouldn’t the three SSRCs be reported in different report blocks in the sender report? Each of the SSRCs will report on all the others, unless the rtp-multi-stream-optimisation draft is used, but so what? Oh, I think I understand what you are saying. You're saying that each media flow (SSRC) would be responsible for sending its own RTCP packets and those packets would be marked in the same way as that media flow. In that case, I agree with you. That said, would we really require the sending SSRC to include any data for the other SSRCs if they're each sending RTCP packets separately? That seems redundant. Does RFC 3550 require that? (It's been a while...) The more difficult case is when an SSRC is sending video using different markings for RTP packets carrying the I- and P-frames. Should that SSRC then mark its RTCP packets like the RTP packets carrying I-frames, like the RTP packets carrying P-frames, or what? For this, I would argue it should be whatever DSCP that has the lower drop precedence (in the case of assured forwarding). Otherwise, it should be the same as the media, I'd think. You mean the RTCP for each SSRC should use the DSCP with the lowest drop preference of those used for the media sent by that SSRC? That's what I'm suggesting. So, a video flow using AF4x would use AF41 for RTCP. I suggest that, since I assume we don't want to lose feedback information if we can avoid it. Paul"}

Answering a question w\/a question :-), how are those reports likely to be used? For example, if the primary use of these reports is to adjust a variable rate codec's sending rate, the P-frame info is probably more useful as indicative of what's happening to the traffic that the network drops first when the going gets rough (or whose delivery w\/o loss indicates that a sending rate increase may be reasonable), which suggests P-frame-like RTCP report marking. I doubt the RTT estimate derived from RTCP is used for congestion control, since it’s too infrequent to get insight into the dynamics. It’s for user experience reporting, maybe rough clustering of receivers, that sort of thing. I'd agree if I didn't have the impression, in RMCAT, that nothing but RTP \/ RTCP is allowed?! So can we send extra packets to probe for the RTT? I’d expect RMCAT will probe the one-way delay variation by measuring the arrival times of RTP packets, and report that in RTCP once per video frame (or so). That would give a much more accurate measurement than a single-packet sample of the RTT derived from RTCP, and would still allow per-frame adaptation. I agree that this is a useful signal to use - but I think you still need a rough idea of the RTT to be able to interoperate with TCP, else you may cause TCP to go into RTOs and be ignorant of that. But this could perhaps be a more coarse signal - maybe that's okay. I think this is reasonable. You have the RTT estimate, irrespective of the other information you include along with the regular RTCP packets, although it’s relatively infrequent and coarse-grained. I wonder if your RTCP draft in RMCAT should clarify this? (sorry if it does already, didn’t check) It probably should talk about this, I agree. -- Colin Perkins http:\/\/csperkins.org\/ On 27 Aug 2014, at 19:47, Michael Welzl <michawe@ifi.uio.no> wrote:On 27. aug. 2014, at 20:42, Colin Perkins <csp@csperkins.org> wrote:On 27 Aug 2014, at 19:39, Michael Welzl <michawe@ifi.uio.no> wrote:On 27. aug. 2014, at 18:00, Colin Perkins <csp@csperkins.org> wrote:The more difficult case is when an SSRC is sending video using differentmarkings for RTP packets carrying the I- and P-frames.
