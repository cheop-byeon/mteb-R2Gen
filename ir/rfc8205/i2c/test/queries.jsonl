Without this inclusion, the AS path cannot be secured; for example, the path can be shortened (by a MITM (man in the middle)) without being detected. It was decided that only the originating AS needs to insert a signature Expire Time in the update, as it is the originator of the route. The origin AS also will re-originate, i.e., beacon, the update prior to the Expire Time of the advertisement (see Section 3.2). (For an explanation of why upstream ASes do not insert their respective signature Expire Times, please see Section 3.2.2.) Expire Time and beaconing were eventually replaced by router key rollover. The BGPsec protocol [RFC8205] is expected to make use of router key rollover to mitigate replay attacks and withdrawal suppression [BGPsec-Rollover] [Replay-Protection]. It was decided that each signed update would include only one NLRI prefix. If more than one NLRI prefix were included and an upstream AS elected to propagate the advertisement for a subset of the prefixes, then the signature(s) on the update would break (see Sections 5.1 and 5.2). If a mechanism were employed to preserve prefixes that were dropped, this would reveal information to subsequent ASes that is not revealed in normal BGP operation. Thus, a trade-off was made to preserve the level of route information exposure that is intrinsic to BGP over the performance hit implied by limiting each update to carry only one prefix. The signature data is carried in an optional, non-transitive BGP attribute. The attribute is optional because this is the standard mechanism available in BGP to propagate new types of data. It was decided that the attribute should be non-transitive because of concern about the impact of sending the (potentially large) signatures to routers that don't understand them. Also, if a router that does not understand BGPsec somehow gets an update message with path signatures (i.e., the update includes the BGPsec_PATH attribute (see Section 3 of RFC 8205)), then it would be undesirable for that router to forward the update to all of its neighbors, especially those who do not understand BGPsec and may choke if they receive many updates with large optional BGP attributes. It is envisioned that BGPsec and traditional BGP will coexist while BGPsec is deployed incrementally."}

The rationale for not signing withdrawals is that BGPsec assumes the use of transport security between neighboring BGPsec routers. Thus, no external entity can inject an update that withdraws a route or replay a previously transmitted update containing a withdrawal. Because the rationale for withdrawing a route is not visible to a neighboring BGPsec router, there are residual vulnerabilities associated with withdrawals. For example, a router that advertised a (valid) route may fail to withdraw that route when it is no longer viable. A router also might re-advertise a route that it previously withdrew, before the route is again viable. This latter vulnerability is mitigated by the Expire Time associated with the origin AS's signature (see Section 3.2). Repeated withdrawals and announcements for a prefix can run up the BGP Route Flap Damping (RFD) penalty [RFC2439] and may result in unreachability for that prefix at upstream routers.

Mitigation of Replay Attacks)\nMitigation of BGPsec update replay attacks can be thought of as protection against malicious re-advertisements of withdrawn routes. If each AS along a path were to insert its own signature Expire Time, then there would be much additional BGP chattiness and an increase in BGP processing load due to the need to detect and react to multiple (possibly redundant) signature Expire Times. Furthermore, there would be no extra benefit from the point of view of mitigation of replay attacks as compared to having a single Expire Time corresponding to the signature of the originating AS. As noted in Section 3.2.1, the recommended Expire Time value is on the order of days, but 4 to 8 hours may be used in some cases on the basis of perceived need for extra protection from replay attacks. Thus, different ASes may choose different values based on the perceived need to protect against malicious route replays. (A shorter Expire Time reduces the window during which an AS can maliciously replay the route. However, shorter Expire Time values cause routes to be refreshed more often, thus causing more BGP chatter.)  Even a 4-hour duration seems long enough to keep the re-origination workload manageable. For example, if 500K routes are re-originated every 4 hours, it amounts to an increase in BGP update load of 35 updates per second; this can be considered reasonable. However, further analysis is needed to confirm these recommendations. As stated in Section 3.2.1, the originating AS will re-originate a route sufficiently in advance of its Expire Time. What is considered \"sufficiently in advance\"?  To answer this question, modeling should be performed to determine the 95th-percentile convergence time of update propagation in a BGPsec-enabled Internet. Each BGPsec router should stagger the Expire Time values in the updates it originates, especially during table dumps to a neighbor or during its own recovery from a BGP session failure. By doing this, the re-origination (i.e., beaconing) workload at the router will be dispersed."}

It was observed that at the edge of the Internet, there are frequent updates that may result from such simple situations as a BGP session being switched from one interface to another (e.g., from primary to backup) between two peering ASes (e.g., customer and provider). With traditional BGP, these updates do not propagate beyond the two ASes involved.

Such updates would not normally change the best path (unless another concurrent event impacts the best path). Expire-Time-triggered updates would have a negligible impact on RFD penalty accumulation because the re-advertisement interval is much longer relative to the half-time of RFD penalty decay. Elaborating further on the third observation above, it may be noted that the re-advertisements (i.e., beacons) of a route for a given address prefix from a given peer will be received at intervals of several hours (see Section 3.2). During that time period, any incremental contribution to the RFD penalty due to an Expire-Time-triggered update would decay sufficiently to have negligible (if any) impact on damping the address prefix in question. Additional details regarding this analysis and justification are as follows: The frequency with which RFD penalty increments may be triggered for a given prefix from a given peer is the same as the re-beaconing frequency for that prefix from its origin AS. The re-beaconing frequency is on the order of once every several hours (see Section 3.2). The incremental RFD penalty assigned to a prefix due to a re-beaconed update varies, depending on the implementation. For example, it appears that the JunOS implementation [JunOS] would assign a penalty of 1000 or 500, depending on whether the re-beaconed update is regarded as a re-advertisement or an attribute change, respectively. Normally, a re-beaconed update would be treated as an attribute change. On the other hand, the Cisco implementation [CiscoIOS] assigns an RFD penalty only in the case of an actual flap (i.e., a route is available, then unavailable, or vice versa). So, it appears that Cisco's implementation of RFD would not assign any penalty for a re-beaconed update (i.e., a route was already advertised previously and was not withdrawn, and the re-beaconed update is merely updating the Expire Time attribute). Even if one assumes that an RFD penalty of 500 is assigned (corresponding to an attribute change according to the JunOS RFD implementation), it can be illustrated that the incremental effect it would have on damping the prefix in question would be negligible: the half-time of RFD penalty decay is normally set to 15 minutes, whereas the re-beaconing frequency is on the order of once every several hours. An incremental penalty of 500 would decay to 31.25 in 1 hour, 0.12 in 2 hours, and 3x10^(-5) in 3 hours. It may also be noted that the threshold for route suppression is 3000 in JunOS and 2000 in Cisco IOS. Based on the foregoing analysis, it may be concluded that routine re-beaconing by itself would not result in RFD suppression of  routes in the BGPsec protocol."}

The SAS could potentially result in savings in bandwidth and in Protocol Data Unit (PDU) size, and maybe in RIB size, but the signature generation and validation costs will be higher as compared to one signature per AS hop. SAS schemes exist in the literature, typically based on RSA or its equivalent.

However, without a SAS, the ECDSA with a 512-bit signature (256-bit key) would suffice for equivalent cryptographic strength. The larger signature size of RSA used with a SAS undermines the advantages of the SAS, because the average hop count, i.e., the number of ASes, for a route is about 3.8. In the end, it may turn out that the SAS has more complexity and does not provide sufficient savings in PDU size or RIB size to merit its use.

Through a private arrangement (invisible to other ASes), an ISP's AS (upstream AS) can truncate the stub AS (or downstream AS) from the path and sign the update as if the prefix is originating from the ISP's AS (even though the update originated unsigned from the customer AS). This way, the path will appear fully signed to the rest of the network. This alternative will require the owner of the prefix at the stub AS to issue a ROA for the upstream AS, so that the upstream AS is authorized to originate routes for the prefix. Another type of arrangement that can also be effected outside of the BGPsec specification is as follows. The stub AS does not sign updates, but it obtains an RPKI (CA) certificate and issues a router certificate under that CA certificate. It passes on the private key for the router certificate to its upstream provider. That ISP (i.e., the second-hop AS) would insert a signature on behalf of the stub AS using the private key obtained from the stub AS. This arrangement is called \"proxy signing\" (see Section 6.6). An extended ROA is created that includes the stub AS as the originator of the prefix and the upstream provider as the second-hop AS, and partial signatures would be allowed (i.e., the stub AS need not sign the updates). It is recognized that this approach is also authoritative and not trust based. It was observed that the extended ROA is not much different from what is done with the ROA (in its current form) when a Provider-Independent (PI) address is originated from a provider's AS. This approach was rejected due to possible complications with the creation and use of a new RPKI object, namely, the extended ROA. Also, the validating BGPsec router has to perform a level of indirection with this approach, i.e., it must detect that an update is not fully signed and then look for the extended ROA to validate. Another method, based on a different form of indirection, would be as follows. The customer (stub) AS registers something like a Proxy Signer Authorization, which authorizes the second-hop (i.e., provider) AS to sign on behalf of the customer AS using the provider's own key [Dynamics]. This method allows for fully signed updates (unlike the approach based on the extended ROA). But this approach also requires the creation of a new RPKI object, namely, the Proxy Signer Authorization. In this approach, the second-hop AS and validating ASes have to perform a level of indirection. This approach was also rejected. The various inputs regarding ISP preferences were taken into consideration, and eventually the decision in favor of asymmetric BGPsec was reached (Section 6.5.1). An advantage for a stub AS that does asymmetric BGPsec is that it only needs to minimally upgrade to BGPsec so it can sign updates to its upstream AS while it receives only unsigned updates. Thus, it can avoid the cost of increased processing and memory needed to perform update validations and to store signed updates in the RIBs, respectively."}

(Note: The IXP's route server does not change the NEXT_HOP attribute even if it inserts its ASN in the path.)  It is very rare for an IXP to use Method C because it is less attractive for the clients if their AS path length increases by one due to the IXP. A measure of the extent of the use of Method A vs. Method B is given in terms of the corresponding IP traffic load percentages. As an example, at a major European IXP, these percentages are about 80% and 20% for Methods A and B, respectively (this data is based on private communication with IXPs circa 2011). However, as the IXP grows (in terms of number of clients), it tends to migrate more towards Method B because of the difficulties of managing up to n x (n-1)\/2 direct interconnections between n peers in Method A. To the extent that an IXP is providing direct bilateral peering between clients (Method A), that model works naturally with BGPsec. Also, if the route server in the IXP plays the role of a regular BGPsec speaker (minus the routing part for payload) and inserts its own ASN in the path (Method C), then that model would also work well in the BGPsec Internet and this case is trivially supported in BGPsec."}

The router's local policy ultimately has control over what action (regarding BGP path selection) is taken. Initially, four validation states were considered: The update is not signed. The update is signed, but the router does not have corresponding RPKI data to perform a validation check. The validation check was performed, and the check failed (Invalid). The validation check was performed, and the check passed (Valid). As stated above, it was later decided that BGPsec validation outcomes will be mapped to one of only two validation states. It was observed that an update can be invalid for many different reasons. To begin to differentiate these numerous reasons and to try to enumerate different flavors of the Invalid state will not likely be constructive in route-selection decisions and may even introduce new vulnerabilities in the system. However, some questions remain, such as the following: Question: Is there a need to define a separate validation state for the case when an update is not signed but the {prefix, origin} pair matches the ROA information?  After some discussion, a tentative conclusion was reached: this is in principle similar to validation based on partial path signing (which was ruled out; see Section 6.4). So, there is no need to add another validation state for this case; treat it as \"Invalid\", considering that it is unsigned. Another remaining question: Would the RP want to give the update a higher preference over another unsigned update that failed origin validation or over a signed update that failed both signature and ROA validation?"}

ISPs may like to carry it over their eBGP links between their own ASes (e.g., sibling ASes). A peer (or customer) may receive it over an eBGP link from a provider and may want to use it to shortcut their own validation check. However, the peer (or customer) should be aware that this validation-state attribute is just a preview of a neighbor's validation and must perform their own validation check to be sure of the actual state of the update's validation. Question: Should validation-state propagation be protected by attestation in cases where it is useful for diagnostics purposes?  The decision was made to not protect the validation-state information using signatures. The following validation states may be needed for propagation via iBGP between edge routers in an AS: Validation states communicated in iBGP for an unsigned update (route origin validation result): (1) Valid, (2) Invalid, (3) NotFound (see [RFC6811]), (4) Validation Deferred. An update could be unsigned for either of the following two reasons, but they need not be distinguished: (a) it had no signatures (i.e., came in unsigned from an eBGP peer) or (b) signatures were present but stripped. Validation states communicated in iBGP for a signed update: (1) Valid, (2) Invalid, (3) Validation Deferred. The reason for conveying the additional \"Validation Deferred\" state may be illustrated as follows. An ingress edge Router A receiving an update from an eBGPsec peer may not attempt to validate signatures (e.g., in a processor overload situation), and in that case Router A should convey \"Validation Deferred\" state for that signed update (if selected for best path) in iBGP to other edge routers. An egress edge Router B, upon receiving the update from ingress Router A, would then be able to perform its own validation (origin validation for an unsigned update or origin\/signature validation for a signed update). As stated before, the egress router (Router B in this example) may always choose to perform its own validation when it receives an update from iBGP (independently of the update's validation status conveyed in iBGP) to account for the possibility of RPKI data skew at different routers. These various choices are local and entirely at the operator's discretion."}

These parameters would apply to BGPsec, just as they apply to traditional BGP. Regarding what happens if the BGP router transitions from traditional BGP to BGP-GR to BGPsec, the answer would simply be as follows. If there is a software upgrade to BGPsec during BGP-GR (assuming that the upgrade is being done on a live BGP speaker), then the BGP-GR session should be terminated before a BGPsec session is initiated. Once the eBGPsec peering session is established, the receiving eBGPsec speaker will see signed updates from the sending (newly upgraded) eBGPsec speaker. There is no apparent harm (it may, in fact, be desirable) if the receiving speaker continues to use previously learned unsigned BGP routes from the sending speaker until they are replaced by new BGPsec routes. However, if the Forwarding State bit is set to zero by the sending speaker (i.e., the newly upgraded speaker) during BGPsec session negotiation, then the receiving speaker would mark all previously learned unsigned BGP routes from that sending speaker as \"stale\" in its Adj-RIB-In. Then, as BGPsec updates are received (possibly interspersed with unsigned BGP updates), the \"stale\" routes will be replaced or refreshed."}

So, the off-router box is probably unlike the traditional route reflector; it sits at the network edge and validates all incoming BGPsec updates. Thus, it appears that each router passes each BGPsec update it receives to the off-router box and receives a validation result before it stores the route in the Adj-RIB-In.
